The YOLO model makes predictions with a single network evaluation. Systems like R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, on the other hand, make multiple assessments for a single image, making YOLO extremely fast, running in real-time with a capable GPU. For detect people used YOLOv3 algorithm which is published by [18] and shows that it has high accuracy to identify people, also we compared the proposed method with other detectors, HOG, SSD and YOLO-tiny which shows the proposed algorithm has better performance in this point. And for finding density areas, We utilized a background subtraction with Gaussian Mixture algorithms and heatmap colour technique to analysis each frame and figure out, where are the density areas which shows people like to spend more time to visit.

Extreme metocean events forecasting and prevention is an urgent computing task from decision-making and for reaction point of view. In this case, urgent computing scenario is an essential part that should be included in the hazard simulation and prevention system However, existed urgent computing technological concepts does not perfectly fit all tasks in a frame of extreme metocean events simulation. Many of these tasks should be executed during the overall lifecycle of hazard prevention system that includes not only urgent scenario but research part, as well In this paper, we decompose all tasks in three groups by most significant computational aspects (taking into consideration different criteria of data processing and high-performance contributions) and suggest a new solution that is adaptable for both research in normal (non-urgent) and urgent computing modes, where potential tasks can be structured in the form of scenarios. Suggested solution implements CLAVIRE platform core and extends its with advanced features (regarding simulation frequency, computational performance and data-driven computing). As an example in the metocean subject area, a complex application for Baltic Sea simulations is presented. The case studies describe three scenarios with proposed infrastructure features that are the most interesting for highlighting relevant problems of metocean simulations within the Baltic Sea.

An experimental study is carried out with a US air transportation network and synthetic social networks with known properties. © 2016","scival":"99.275","badges":["Complex networks","Evolutionary computing","Simulated annealing","Transportation network","Air transportation","Heuristic methods","Simulated annealing","Topology","Transportation","Air transportation networks","Evolutionary computing","Evolutionary simulations","Functional characteristics","Node degree distribution","Simulated annealing algorithms","Topological properties","Transportation network","Complex networks"],"publicationTitle":"Journal of Applied Logic","journalInfo":["Journal of Applied Logic","Volume 24, November 2017, Pages 39-49",""],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation\nNetherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences, Wassenaar, Netherlands","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56085003300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85007574328","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57188736825&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85007574328","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57197019872&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85007574328","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55382199400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85007574328","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6603474810&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85007574328"],"ctime":1581093521,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007574328&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=d2d0f5c3f9c762cf658f5387418d59b3&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857197019872%29&relpos=6&citeCnt=1&searchTerm=","taskid":"8a369172bea8b1638d21368612ee2a65"}

Big modern cities offer a multimodal selection of methods to transfer between the parts of the city, including various types of ground transportation and a subway. On the other hand, passengers' model choice depends on the available routes, often historically formed without regard to modern passenger needs and fast-changing of cities life. As a result, for the optimization of public transport systems we should understand how the rules are formed, followed by passengers when choosing a specific route. This paper discusses the evaluation of modal-choice rules through ground transportation modeling using historical data collected from turnstiles in the subway and census data. The results should help in identifying the critical places in the existing infrastructure and transportation planning of big cities.

In this study, we investigate the nature of the transport accessibility with various types of movement using open data and modeling approach. The aim of the study is to find the critical deficiencies in transport infrastructure and predict transport accessibility under changes of infrastructure and city growth. The proposed model can be the basis for optimization of public transport routes, schedules and periods of repairs.

Many assumptions in an urban science may be made by analysing traffic flows and vehicle behaviour on city streets. Since road traffic is a dynamic and possibly spatially large system that depends on many external conditions, approaches like visual analysis and computational steering may be used. There are many traffic modelling frameworks presented in the field, but there are also several drawbacks most of them have: they are limited to a specific model or case; have abstracted logic which disregards some factors affecting vehicle movement; they ignore possible physical interactions which are not described in a model or use too many simplifications in vehicle interaction simulations. In this paper, a novel agent-based traffic modelling framework is presented, combining different classes of traffic models into a single vehicle agent and allowing the user to set a specific model for each supported class. The framework was made using a game engine, Unreal Engine 4, which allows users to model realistic interaction between vehicles and make realistic visualisations for purposes of visual analysis and computational steering. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"99.059","badges":["agent-based modelling","car-following models","scientific visualization","Traffic modelling","Autonomous agents","Computation theory","Computational methods","Data visualization","Multi agent systems","Roads and streets","Steering","Traffic control","Visualization","Agent-based modelling","Car following models","Computational steering","External conditions","Physical interactions","Traffic modelling","Traffic simulations","Vehicle interactions","Automobile steering equipment"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 443-452","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192819308&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85060541210","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217925700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85060541210","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218197100&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85060541210"],"ctime":1581093592,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060541210&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=92c17fa5ff5d60b9dc7384a008294eee&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856217925700%29&relpos=3&citeCnt=2&searchTerm=","taskid":"25ba75860ec13c96035524a401776ecd"}

That leads to the need to develop new fast and efficient methods of landscapes generation. However, lack of flexibility of user control over terrain generation in most popular modern terrain generation algorithms is a big part of terrain generation problem. In this paper, we present a new method for generating three-dimensional landscapes based on modified Dijkstra algorithm. The proposed method allows a user to set the initial location of landscape features and select or create weight functions that determine the appearance of the generated terrain. It has a lower computational cost compared to the closest analogs giving the equal quality of results and allows users to create various types of terrain, as well as to combine them together in one landscape. © 2016 The Authors.

For the demonstration of the efficiency of surrogate-assisted multi-fidelity approach, it was compared with the baseline evolutionary calibration approach. The second advantage was assured by additional increasing of optimisation quality in the presence of strict deadline due to the building the strategy of multi-fidelity fitness approximation directly during the evolutionary algorithm execution. In order to prove the efficiency of the proposed dynamic strategy, it was compared with the preliminary meta-optimisation approach. As a case study, the wind wave model SWAN is used.

For modelling we use clinical data of CHF patients. For each task the groups of static and dynamic features are selected and analyzed. For each task 3 machine learning algorithms were trained: XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest for multi classification and Linear Regression, Decision Tree and XGBoost for the regression task. Different combinations of features were examined from both groups applying forward feature selection algorithm.

The study was based on the case histories of 6864 patients with diabetes mellitus, 90% of whom suffer from type 2 diabetes. Our method allows to predict the sequence of events during the development of type 2 diabetes for each patient. Typical developmental trajectories of the disease were investigated, their clustering was carried out, the trajectory patterns were identified and studied. Based on the constructed directed graph reflecting transitions between different conditions of the patients, the clustering of diabetic statuses was carried out using the Modularity Class method; 8 clusters were selected, each of them was interpreted and studied. The method of the disease developmental trajectories creation by means of machine learning methods was described. Unlike static models of a disease course, this method considers complete past information on the patient and his or her previous events, using each event of the course of disease to predict the next event.","scival":"83.589","badges":["Dynamic model of the type 2 diabetes course","event clustering","machine learning","non-insulin-dependent diabetes","the probability of the disease course complicating","the trajectory of the disease course","chronic disease","cluster analysis","disease exacerbation","female","forecasting","human","male","non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","theoretical model","Chronic Disease","Cluster Analysis","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Disease Progression","Female","Forecasting","Humans","Male","Models, Theoretical"],"publicationTitle":"Studies in health technology and informatics","journalInfo":["Studies in health technology and informatics","Volume 261, 2019, Pages 150-155",""],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57209274711&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192820292&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57200213601&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55382199400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753"],"ctime":1581093681,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067109753&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=c4d81a8fe6af0553c0b6418c2d7186b9&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2855382199400%29&relpos=9&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"9e2a0b3cc87d250a081358ea113738a8"}

One of the objectives of the study is the possibility to identify patterns and relationships in patient characteristics for more accurate appointment procedures based on the history of the disease and the individual characteristics of the patient. This is achieved by using classifications models based on machine learning methods. Early detection of disease risks and \"accurate\" appointment of diagnostic procedures makes a significant contribution to value-based medicine. Moreover, it was also possible to identify the classes and characteristics of patients for whom repeated diagnostic procedures are well founded. Calculation of personal risks from empirical retrospective data helps to detect the disease in early stages. Identifying patients with high risk of disease complications allow physicians to make right decisions about timely treatment, which can significantly improve the quality of treatment, and help to avoid diseases complications, optimize costs and improve the quality of medical care.","scival":"94.243","badges":["4P medicine","data mining","ECHO","echocardiography","machine learning","Russian cardiac population","echocardiography","human","machine learning","medicine","retrospective study","Russian Federation","Echocardiography","Humans","Machine Learning","Medicine","Retrospective Studies","Russia"],"publicationTitle":"Studies in health technology and informatics","journalInfo":["Studies in health technology and informatics","Volume 261, 2019, Pages 137-142",""],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57200213601&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067104140","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57188740055&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067104140","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57209275095&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067104140","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55382199400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067104140"],"ctime":1581093685,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067104140&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=c4d81a8fe6af0553c0b6418c2d7186b9&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2855382199400%29&relpos=10&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"6de0e45c54fec56327b89b7bf81ccde6"}

The DSL has a declarative style that requires the user to define the description of needed data and based on an ontological model of social networks and the essential crawling techniques.

The approach is described with a conceptual framework and basic methods for combination of different techniques. The implementation of the proposed approach for simulation of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was developed and used in an experimental study. Methods: A combination of data, text, process mining techniques, and machine learning approaches for the analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) with discrete-event simulation (DES) and queueing theory for the simulation of patient flow was proposed. The performed analysis of EHRs for ACS patients enabled identification of several classes of clinical pathways (CPs) which were used to implement a more realistic simulation of the patient flow. The developed solution was implemented using Python libraries (SimPy, SciPy, and others). Results: The proposed approach enables more a realistic and detailed simulation of the patient flow within a group of related departments. An experimental study shows an improved simulation of patient length of stay for ACS patient flow obtained from EHRs in Almazov National Medical Research Centre in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

We discuss the topical structures of ICCS, and show how these topics have evolved over time in response to the topicality of various domains, technologies and methods, and how all these topics relate to one another. This analysis illustrates the multidisciplinary research and collaborations among scientific communities, by constructing static and dynamic networks from the topic modelling results and from the authors’ keywords. The results of this study provide insights regarding the past and future trends of core discussion topics in computational science and show how “computational thinking” has propagated across different fields of study. We used the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic modelling algorithm to discover topics. The resulting topics were then manually labelled and grouped hierarchically on three levels. Next, we applied trend analysis and Change Point Analysis (CPA) to study the evolution of topics over seventeen years and to identify the growing and disappearing topics. We used Gephi to examine the static networks of topics, and an R library called DyA to analyse the dynamic networks of topics. We also analysed the conference as a platform for potential collaboration development through the perspective of collaboration networks. The results show that authors of ICCS papers continue to actively collaborate after the conference − on average authors collaborate with three other ICCS authors, − which suggests that ICCS is a valuable platform for collaboration development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","scival":"99.165","badges":["Collaboration networks","Computational science","Graph theory","ICCS","Natural language processing","Topic modelling","Computation theory","Factorization","Matrix algebra","Modeling languages","Natural language processing systems","Collaboration network","Computational science","Computational thinkings","ICCS","Multi-disciplinary research","Nonnegative matrix factorization","Publication activities","Topic modelling","Graph theory"],"publicationTitle":"Journal of Computational Science","journalInfo":["Journal of Computational Science","Volume 26, May 2018, Pages 193-204",""],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Russian Federation\nUniversity of Amsterdam, Netherlands\nEötvös University, Hungary","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190224801&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55382199400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217679300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57195350597&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56644935700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57204250277&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=8385944600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57202586742&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224"],"ctime":1581093723,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046377224&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=c4d81a8fe6af0553c0b6418c2d7186b9&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2855382199400%29&relpos=19&citeCnt=4&searchTerm=","taskid":"ff39f8b82f384cafba06e62b6ff169a6"}

Sophistication of ships and marine platforms and expansion of offshore activities to non-investigated regions means increasing of probability of being damaged by high waves. Hindcasting of wave fields, using the hydrodynamic models is main approach to wave climate investigation. Offshore wave measurements are used, mainly, for model verification. In compliance with existent regulatory documents and accepted practice applied statistical characteristics of wind waves are prescribed to operational and extreme. Operational statistics describe wind and wave conditions for the life span of a ship or an offshore structure. Extreme characteristics determine the so-called \"structure survival regime\". There are a lot of approaches to calculations of extreme wave heights at a point (classical unconditional extremes). Their comparison shows the advantages and disadvantages of each of them. Freak (rogue) waves have some principal difference from extreme wave, mainly due to their form and asymmetry. In this sense freak wave is a multidimensional extreme. Contaminated distribution may be used for probability density approximation of joint extreme and freak wave. The example of recent freak wave event is the loss of ship \"Aurelia\" (Class of Russian Register of shipping) in February 2005 in the North Pacific. \"Aurelia\" sunk during passing of atmospheric front with veering wind, changing wind waves. Any wave has at least three dimensions: height, length, and crest length. The last parameter in mean is 3 times greater than wave length. Any information about three dimensional waves is of interest, as such measurements are unique. Some results of unique stereo wave measurements in the South Pacific where the wave as high as 24.9m was fixed (probably still almost the highest measured in the World Ocean), is presented and discussed.

In particular, it was found that, over time, the connections between the types of such diseases. In the female population are significantly complicated (as evidenced by the increase in the number of links in the developed model), while for men the opposite picture was observed - with age, the number of connections between comorbidities decreased. This allowed us to conclude that in the considered population, women live longer (by estimation the size of the datasets) and are more inclined to acquire new comorbidities. The male population, in contrast, is subject to early mortality. The connections between comorbidity diseases for men become less complex with time.

The key issues which form the research problem include a high diversity of patients' population, simultaneous appearance of multiple chronic diseases, aged patients as a major target group. Also, one of the most important problems being raised in this research is limited observation available for chronic diseases as the long development of chronic disease is usually happening outside the hospital. The approach is based on systematization and collection of data from diverse sources and models describing various aspects of disease progression, life conditions, treatment process within a single comprehensive solution. The goal of such solution is lowering of existing limitation and uncertainty for predictive modeling and simulation of chronic diseases. A target application of the approach considered within the project is decision support systems for both patients and physicians during treatment of chronic disease.

As the majority of hypertensive patients are of older age, they also have many comorbid diseases. Optimized treatment is supposed to be targeted to the specific cluster of comorbidities. The objective of study is to find effective algorithms for clustering of comorbidities in hypertensive patients. Hierarchical structure of diseases, their types and groups was extracted from text descriptions in EHR database of Federal Almazov North-West Medical Research Centre. Three approaches were tested to find connections between comorbidities: frequency analysis, association rules mining and Bayesian networks. Robust cluster of diseases was found and contains cardiovascular, endocrinological, musculoskeletal and nervous system groups. Further research will be focused on investigating this cluster at the next level of hierarchy and incorporating time scale data of patients' visits into analysis.","scival":"98.517","badges":["Bayesian networks","Clustering algorithms","Arterial hypertension","Association rules mining","Conditional probabilities","Effective algorithms","Frequency Analysis","Hierarchical structures","Hypertensive patients","Medical research","Diseases"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 108, 2017, Pages 2478-2487","International Conference on Computational Science ICCS 2017; ETH ZurichZurich; Switzerland; 12 June 2017 до 14 June 2017; Код 136818"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation\nFederal Almazov North-West Medical Research Centre, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56524584500&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85027318062","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56955559700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85027318062","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57188737492&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85027318062","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57195344550&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85027318062","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57200733249&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85027318062","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6506439053&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85027318062","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7004144504&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85027318062"],"ctime":1581093872,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027318062&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=a0314f1ef6e7f3288d4e7edd12c12a0e&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856955559700%29&relpos=10&citeCnt=2&searchTerm=","taskid":"8b4da6f6a00b2f567fd2d9a6607b6cec"}

To take into account all aspects of the specifics of evacuation in storm conditions, an information model has been developed. This model is based on three interrelated processes: sea waves dynamics, ship motions under the influence of sea, crowd dynamics affected by ship motions. In our research, we developed a combined method for simulating agents' movements on the inclined decks of the ship. Our approach combines the well-known implementation of the Social Force model with the possibility of collisions with obstacles. Depending on the specific requirements, it is possible to use various models for ship dynamics in irregular seas. To better support this versatility, a distributed test bench based on the CLAVIRE cloud platform was developed for simulation of passenger evacuation and testing simulations were carried out.

Evacuation process depends on many different factors such as environmental properties (e.g. wind velocity, intensity of waves), human behavioral aspects and so on. In order to describe passengers' behavior in case of emergency evacuation considering the inclination of a ship, we applied a force-based model adapted from multi-agent system. Our approach provides an opportunity to estimate evacuation time depending on intensity of waves, rate of sailing and relative direction. Our proposed model can be coupled with the simulation of ship flooding or fire propagation.

In this paper, we present an extension of classic OP—Orienteering Problem with Functional Profits (OPFP), where the score of a specific point depends on its characteristics, position in the route, and other points in the route. For solving OPFP, we developed an open-source framework for solving orienteering problems, which utilizes four core components of OP in its modular architecture. Fully-written in Go programming language our framework can be extended for solving different types of tasks with different algorithms; this was demonstrated by implementation of two popular algorithms for OP solving—Ant Colony Optimization and Recursive Greedy Algorithm. Computational efficiency of the framework was shown through solving four well-known OP types: classic Orienteering Problem (OP), Orienteering Problem with Compulsory Vertices (OPCV), Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW), and Time Dependent Orienteering Problem (TDOP) along with OPFP.

Thus, there is no surprise that in the field of social media analysis the research agenda has moved from the development of event detection methods to a brand new area - event prediction models. This research field is extremely important for all sorts of applications, from natural disasters preparation and criminal activity prevention to urban management and development of smart cities. However, even the leading models have an important disadvantage: they are based on prior knowledge about events being expected. So forecasting systems based on such models are heavily limited by a list of events that can be predicted and all events of other types will be out of systems' scope. In this work, we try to address this issue and propose a deep learning model, which is able to predict an area of the future event in the urban environment. This model is able to predict the future state of the city - a level of users activity in the location-based social network Instagram - with the average deviation from the ground truth of 1%, and achieves 69% recall when solving the events prediction problem. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It means that a scientist from physics, biology or even sociology should struggle with all technical issues on the way of building distributed multi-scale application supported by a stack of specific technologies on high-performance clusters. As the result, created applications have partly implemented logic and are extremely inefficient in execution. In this paper, we present an approach which takes away the user from the necessity to care about an efficient resolving of imbalance of computations being performed in different processes and on different scales of his application. The efficient balance of internal workload in distributed and multi-scale applications may be achieved by introducing: a special multi-level model; a contract (or domain-specific language) to formulate the application in terms of this model; and a scheduler which operates on top of that model. The multi-level model consists of computing routines, computational resources and executed processes, determines a mapping between them and serves as a mean to evaluate the resulting performance of the whole application and its individual parts. The contract corresponds to unification interface of application integration in the proposed framework while the scheduling algorithm optimizes the execution process taking into consideration the main computational environment aspects. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","scival":"89.206","badges":["Distributed computing","HPC","MPI","Multi-agent modeling","Multi-scale applications","Optimization","Computer aided software engineering","Distributed computer systems","Multi agent systems","Optimization","Problem oriented languages","Scheduling algorithms","Application integration","Computational environments","Computational resources","Distributed applications","Domain specific languages","High performance cluster","Multi-Agent Model","Multi-scale","Computation theory"],"publicationTitle":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","journalInfo":["Communications in Computer and Information Science","Volume 965, 2019, Pages 675-686","4th Russian Supercomputing Days Conference, RuSCDays 2018; Moscow; Russian Federation; 24 September 2018 до 25 September 2018; Код 222689"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation\nLobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Federation\nResearch Computing Center of Moscow State University, Moscow, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56086498600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218218400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57014741500&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56644935700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57205408722&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57189293745&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56992702500&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57035333400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148"],"ctime":1581093970,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059904148&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=e3ab57b5e01fca322d8e24a8b140c6ba&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856644935700%29&relpos=4&citeCnt=1&searchTerm=","taskid":"5e67515968e5da0dd913f8c5961af76f"}

In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of quadtree - convolutional quadtree (ConvTree) - and demonstrate its advantage compared to the standard quadtree. We also introduce the algorithm for searching events of different scales using geospatial data obtained from social networks. The algorithm is based on statistical analysis of historical data, generation of ConvTrees representing the normal state of the city and anomalies evaluation for events detection. Experimental study conducted on the dataset of 60 million geotagged Instagram posts in the New York City area demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to find a wide range of events from very local (indie band concert or wedding party) to city (baseball game or holiday march) and even country scale (political protest or Christmas) events.

This analysis illustrates the multidisciplinary research and collaborations among scientific communities, by constructing static and dynamic networks from the topic modelling results and from the authors’ keywords. The results of this study provide insights regarding the past and future trends of core discussion topics in computational science and show how “computational thinking” has propagated across different fields of study. We used the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic modelling algorithm to discover topics. The resulting topics were then manually labelled and grouped hierarchically on three levels. Next, we applied trend analysis and Change Point Analysis (CPA) to study the evolution of topics over seventeen years and to identify the growing and disappearing topics. We used Gephi to examine the static networks of topics, and an R library called DyA to analyse the dynamic networks of topics. We also analysed the conference as a platform for potential collaboration development through the perspective of collaboration networks.

The main disadvantage of existing specialized topologies is a difficulty to implement an efficient data placement that takes into account locality of the data. In scientific problems very often it is necessary to provide the semantic proximity of the data at the nodes of the distributed system. Core drawback of modern consensus protocols is that most of them use messaging through broadcasting, which is impossible for large amounts of data and storage nodes. With more stringent requirements for a fault tolerance, e.g. requirement for resistance to Byzantine errors [1], ensuring of data localization becomes nearly impossible. The purpose of this paper is to implement a distributed consensus protocol that preserves data localization and is resistant to Byzantine errors. Theoretical tasks: a) consider how to implement distributed services based on finite state machines; b) consider how to ensure Byzantine fault tolerance; c) consider methods for organizing the semantic proximity of data. Practical tasks: a) develop ways to jointly ensure the Byzantine fault tolerance and locality of data; b) study the shortcomings of the joint provision of Byzantine fault tolerance and locality of data; c) develop a protocol of Byzantine consensus using semantic links between data; d) analyze the performance of the developed protocol within the framework of applied tasks. The object of the study is a distributed data storage system with the requirement for Byzantine fault tolerance. The subject of this study is the provision of Byzantine fault tolerance in conjunction with the use of semantic links between the data. The subject of this study has never been the subject of a special scientific study. Separate scientific foundations of this problematic set in the present study were developed in separate works on Byzantine fault tolerance, local hash methods and dimensional reduction. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"93.137","badges":["Byzantine errors","data locality","distributed storage","fault tolerance","hash ring","protocol","Digital storage","Distributed database systems","Errors","Fault tolerance","Multiprocessing systems","Network protocols","Semantics","Topology","Byzantine fault tolerance","Data locality","Dimensional reduction","Distributed data storages","Distributed storage","Distributed storage system","Scientific foundations","Stringent requirement","Fault tolerant computer systems"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 25-34","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57195347975&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062494422","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56644935700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062494422","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56086498600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062494422"],"ctime":1581094000,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062494422&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=e3ab57b5e01fca322d8e24a8b140c6ba&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856644935700%29&relpos=11&citeCnt=1&searchTerm=","taskid":"ef3296f21ccf9f5d66952d97cacf9bd3"}

A large number of studies have focused on the optical activity of semiconductor nanocrystals induced by chiral ligands adsorbed on the nanocrystal's surface. Here for the first time, we report an experimental study on the opposite effect and the influence of semiconductor nanocrystals on the optical activity of chiral molecules. Hybrid nanostructures based on a chiral organic dye, chlorin e6, and various semiconductor nanocrystals (CdSe quantum dots of a range of diameters, core/shell CdSe/CdS quantum dots and CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic techniques. Overall, it has been found that the chlorin e6 optical activity increases when chlorin e6 was bound to nanocrystals. In the case of CdSe QDs, this phenomenon showed a strong dependency on the quantum dot size, with smaller diameters resulting in a larger optical activity increase and vice versa. Moreover, in the case of core/shell CdSe/CdS QDs, it was found that by varying the nanocrystal shell thickness, it was possible to control the resulting distance between the nanocrystal core and chlorin e6. From this, it has been established that decreasing the distance between the nanocrystal core and chlorin e6 resulted in an increase in the chlorin e6 optical activity. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","scival":"99.471","badges":["Cadmium compounds","II-VI semiconductors","Ligands","Molecules","Nanocrystals","Optical materials","Selenium compounds","Semiconducting cadmium compounds","Semiconducting selenium compounds","Semiconductor quantum dots","Stereochemistry","CdSe quantum dots","Chiral molecule","Hybrid nanostructures","Optical activity","Organic molecules","Quantum-dot size","Semiconductor nanocrystals","Spectroscopic technique","Sulfur compounds"],"publicationTitle":"Journal of Materials Chemistry C","journalInfo":["Journal of Materials Chemistry C","Volume 6, Issue 7, 2018, Pages 1759-1766",""],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, St.-Petersburg, 197101, Russian Federation\nSchool of Chemistry and CRANN, University of Dublin, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56316768900&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85042202533","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7102642341&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85042202533","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55346107800&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85042202533","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56204268400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85042202533","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56644935700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85042202533","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55316965600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85042202533","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55247072700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85042202533","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7201565128&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85042202533","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=14008386700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85042202533","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57210556445&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85042202533"],"ctime":1581094017,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042202533&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=e3ab57b5e01fca322d8e24a8b140c6ba&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856644935700%29&relpos=15&citeCnt=2&searchTerm=","taskid":"ec5696737146f4c0d0ccc64bfdb5b213"}

Visualization is a very important part of data analysis since it provides an easy and fast way to assess the data and understand, which parts of it are of particular interest and whether there are any errors in the dataset. The most efficient type of tools for meteorological data visualization are geographic information systems (GIS) because they provide great functionality for manipulating geospatial data.

Moreover, performance models, which are used for the estimation of obtained solutions, are crucial parts of workflow scheduling. In this work we present a combined approach for automatic parameters tuning and performance models construction in the background of the WMS lifecycle.

After that, we used two different ways for data clustering-graphic clustering method comprising N-body communication graph and a keyword-based hierarchical clustering. As a result of our studies we propose method for dynamic visualization of scientific papers clusters, built using open-access data. © 2015 IEEE.","scival":"39.585","badges":["citation graph","Citation Network","keywords analysis","Cluster analysis","Clustering algorithms","Visualization","Citation graphs","Citation networks","Communication graphs","Dynamic visualization","Hier-archical clustering","Keywords analysis","Scientific results","Scientometric analysis","Data visualization"],"publicationTitle":null,"journalInfo":["9th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies, AICT 2015 - Proceedings","25 November 2015, Номер статьи 7338593, Pages 423-427","9th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies, AICT 2015; Rostov-on-Don; Russian Federation; 14 October 2015 до 16 October 2015; Номер категорииCFP1556H-PRT; Код 118382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56780131100&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84960904710","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56644935700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84960904710","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57014741500&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84960904710","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57035333400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84960904710","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218218400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84960904710"],"ctime":1581094071,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960904710&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=e3ab57b5e01fca322d8e24a8b140c6ba&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856644935700%29&relpos=28&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"2a317dec4cea95fb0454df992dfb7c11"}

A stochastic Kronecker graph (SKG) is a network generative model that allows reproducing real-world networks while keeping their important topological properties. When sizes of SKGs reach dozens of millions of nodes, there is a need to apply parallel computations to simulate processes on networks stored in a distributed manner. In general, parallel simulation of a dynamical process on a complex network implies all-to-all communication between subnetworks at each iteration. In this paper, we study the efficiency of different SKG partitioning algorithms and different data interchange algorithms for dynamical process simulation on large SKGs. We compare the theoretical efficiency given by parallel performance models with experimental results for different communication patterns. An experimental part of the study was carried out for sparse SKGs with a size up to one billion nodes using Lomonosov supercomputer (Moscow State University, Russian Federation). The results show that: (i) proposed algorithm of SKG partitioning provides highly balanced results, (ii) observed parallel performance is well agreed with presented theoretical models, (iii) the scheme with all-to-all-communications between subnetworks is the most efficient up to approximately one hundred cores, (iv) master–slave scheme with a single master per node outperforms all-to-all scheme for a large size of a communicator (for our experiments, it has achieved near-linear speedup for up to several hundred processes). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","scival":"96.830","badges":["Complex networks","Dynamical processes","Load balancing","Parallel efficiency","Parallel simulation","Stochastic Kronecker graphs","Distributed computer systems","Efficiency","Iterative methods","Resource allocation","Stochastic models","Stochastic systems","Supercomputers","Topology","All-to-all communication","Dynamical process","Kronecker","Moscow State University","Parallel efficiency","Parallel simulations","Partitioning algorithms","Topological properties","Complex networks"],"publicationTitle":"Future Generation Computer Systems","journalInfo":["Future Generation Computer Systems","Volume 78, January 2018, Pages 502-515",""],"affiliationlist":"e-Science Research Institute, ITMO University 49, Kronverksky Pr., St. Petersburg, 197101, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217679300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85027412386","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190225059&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85027412386","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6603474810&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85027412386"],"ctime":1581094105,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027412386&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=1cd7d79b76499ae902b1bb63b18d4f58&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857190225059%29&relpos=2&citeCnt=5&searchTerm=","taskid":"7bc45b7ee3ad5deca3302d3fe1873cd9"}

The results show that METIS provides more balanced partitions than depth-first traversal heuristic in terms of the edge-cut while sizes of subnetworks are balanced in both cases. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"96.830","badges":["complex networks","graph partitioning","information spread","load balancing","social networks","Complex networks","Resource allocation","Social networking (online)","Comparative studies","Computational process","Dynamic load balancing algorithms","Graph Partitioning","Graph partitioning algorithms","information spread","Online social networks (OSNs)","Parallel Computation","Graph theory"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 218-227","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, 49 Kronverkskii, St. Petersburg, 197101, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190225059&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062570184","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56780445600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062570184","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57195347448&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062570184","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217679300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062570184"],"ctime":1581094110,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062570184&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=1cd7d79b76499ae902b1bb63b18d4f58&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857190225059%29&relpos=3&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"c14d42277e156ea008152a07b7c9428a"}

There are many factors affecting the information spreading. On the one hand, we must take into account the features of post and information sources, on the other hand, it is necessary to understand how users react to posts. Moreover, social networks (as well as some natural and technical systems) allow for collecting the data about the actual state of a dynamical process, thus providing the input data for assimilation within the simulation. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent approach for predicting the dissemination of information taking into account both retrospective data and information about the states of the agents within a social network at the current moment. During simulation process, the model receives network state data in form of batches and can modify internal parameters for more accurate prediction. The parallel realization of this approach allows to perform simulation at a reasonable time. The results show that the accuracy of prediction may be significantly improved using additional information collected from an online social network. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"99.402","badges":["forecasting","information spread","parallel algorithm","social network","Forecasting","Multi agent systems","Parallel algorithms","Data and information","Information sources","information spread","Information spreading","Multi-agent approach","On-line social networks","Parallel realizations","Sources of informations","Social networking (online)"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 228-235","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, 49 Kronverksky pr., St Petersburg, 197101, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57195347448&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190225059&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192819264&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217679300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286"],"ctime":1581094114,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062510286&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=1cd7d79b76499ae902b1bb63b18d4f58&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857190225059%29&relpos=4&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"0315a5444a2b0d1eea4e6619af13f2fc"}

Most of the existing models (aggregated as SIR-like or network-based as independent cascades) use the assumption of homogeneity of an audience. However, to make a model plausible for a description of real-world processes and to measure the accumulated impact of information on individuals, one needs to personalize the characteristics of users as well as sources of information. In this paper, we propose an approach to data-driven simulation of information spread in social networks which combines a set of different models in a unified framework. It includes a model of a user (including sub-models of reaction and daily activity), a model of message generation by information source and a model of message transfer within a user network. The parameters of models (e.g. for different types of agents) are identified by data from the largest Russian social network vk.com. For this study, we collected the network of users associated with charity community (~33.7 million nodes). To tackle with huge size of networks, we implemented parallel version of modeling framework and tested it on the Lomonosov supercomputer.

Many assumptions in an urban science may be made by analysing traffic flows and vehicle behaviour on city streets. Since road traffic is a dynamic and possibly spatially large system that depends on many external conditions, approaches like visual analysis and computational steering may be used. There are many traffic modelling frameworks presented in the field, but there are also several drawbacks most of them have: they are limited to a specific model or case; have abstracted logic which disregards some factors affecting vehicle movement; they ignore possible physical interactions which are not described in a model or use too many simplifications in vehicle interaction simulations. In this paper, a novel agent-based traffic modelling framework is presented, combining different classes of traffic models into a single vehicle agent and allowing the user to set a specific model for each supported class.

That leads to the need to develop new fast and efficient methods of landscapes generation. However, lack of flexibility of user control over terrain generation in most popular modern terrain generation algorithms is a big part of terrain generation problem. In this paper, we present a new method for generating three-dimensional landscapes based on modified Dijkstra algorithm. The proposed method allows a user to set the initial location of landscape features and select or create weight functions that determine the appearance of the generated terrain. It has a lower computational cost compared to the closest analogs giving the equal quality of results and allows users to create various types of terrain, as well as to combine them together in one landscape. © 2016 The Authors.

The resulting computational cost was lower when compared to that of the built-in AGRIF nesting system. Ice and tracer boundary-condition schemes were modified to achieve the correct interaction between coarse- and fine grids through a long ice-covered open boundary.

Advantages of the suggested strategy are based on two main concepts. The first advantage was provided by reducing the overall optimisation time due to the surrogate modelling of fitness function with the iterative gradual refinement of the environmental model fidelity (spatial and temporal resolution) for improving the fitness approximation. For the demonstration of the efficiency of surrogate-assisted multi-fidelity approach, it was compared with the baseline evolutionary calibration approach. The second advantage was assured by additional increasing of optimisation quality in the presence of strict deadline due to the building the strategy of multi-fidelity fitness approximation directly during the evolutionary algorithm execution. In order to prove the efficiency of the proposed dynamic strategy, it was compared with the preliminary meta-optimisation approach. As a case study, the wind wave model SWAN is used.

Growing complexity of such composite model leads to the need of specific approaches for management of such model. This need extends where the model itself becomes a complex system. One of the important aspects of complex model management is dealing with the uncertainty of various kinds (context, parametric, structural, and input/output) to control the model. In the situation where a system being modeled, or modeling requirements change over time, specific methods and tools are needed to make modeling and application procedures (metamodeling operations) in an automatic manner. To support automatic building and management of complex models we propose a general evolutionary computation approach which enables managing of complexity and uncertainty of various kinds. The approach is based on an evolutionary investigation of model phase space to identify the best model’s structure and parameters. Examples of different areas (healthcare, hydrometeorology, and social network analysis) were elaborated with the proposed approach and solutions. Copyright © 2018 Sergey V.

In this paper, we present an extension of classic OP—Orienteering Problem with Functional Profits (OPFP), where the score of a specific point depends on its characteristics, position in the route, and other points in the route. For solving OPFP, we developed an open-source framework for solving orienteering problems, which utilizes four core components of OP in its modular architecture. Fully-written in Go programming language our framework can be extended for solving different types of tasks with different algorithms; this was demonstrated by implementation of two popular algorithms for OP solving—Ant Colony Optimization and Recursive Greedy Algorithm. Computational efficiency of the framework was shown through solving four well-known OP types: classic Orienteering Problem (OP), Orienteering Problem with Compulsory Vertices (OPCV), Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW), and Time Dependent Orienteering Problem (TDOP) along with OPFP. Experiments were conducted on a large multi-source dataset for Saint Petersburg, Russia, containing data from Instagram, TripAdvisor, Foursquare and official touristic website. Our framework is able to construct touristic paths for different OP types within few seconds using dataset with thousands of points of interest. © 2019 Mukhina et al.

Thus, there is no surprise that in the field of social media analysis the research agenda has moved from the development of event detection methods to a brand new area - event prediction models. This research field is extremely important for all sorts of applications, from natural disasters preparation and criminal activity prevention to urban management and development of smart cities. However, even the leading models have an important disadvantage: they are based on prior knowledge about events being expected. So forecasting systems based on such models are heavily limited by a list of events that can be predicted and all events of other types will be out of systems' scope. In this work, we try to address this issue and propose a deep learning model, which is able to predict an area of the future event in the urban environment. This model is able to predict the future state of the city - a level of users activity in the location-based social network Instagram - with the average deviation from the ground truth of 1%, and achieves 69% recall when solving the events prediction problem. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present an approach which takes away the user from the necessity to care about an efficient resolving of imbalance of computations being performed in different processes and on different scales of his application. The efficient balance of internal workload in distributed and multi-scale applications may be achieved by introducing: a special multi-level model; a contract (or domain-specific language) to formulate the application in terms of this model; and a scheduler which operates on top of that model. The multi-level model consists of computing routines, computational resources and executed processes, determines a mapping between them and serves as a mean to evaluate the resulting performance of the whole application and its individual parts.

We propose three different deep learning architectures that are able to solve a target problem and show that convolutional neural network based on three-dimensional convolution layers provides the best results with accuracy of 99%. © 2018 FRUCT Oy.","scival":"99.293","badges":["Convolution","Deep learning","Neural networks","Social networking (online)","Convolutional neural network","Efficient monitoring","Forecasting system","High-accuracy","Learning architectures","New York city","Online activities","Spatial data","Forecasting"],"publicationTitle":null,"journalInfo":["Conference of Open Innovation Association, FRUCT","Volume 2018-November, 24 December 2018, Номер статьи 8588075, Pages 268-275","23rd Conference of Open Innovations Association FRUCT, FRUCT 2018; Bologna; Italy; 13 November 2018 до 16 November 2018; Номер категорииCFP1867Z-ART; Код 143870"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57035333400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85061037101","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56644935700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85061037101","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57195350597&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85061037101","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56086498600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85061037101"],"ctime":1581094217,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061037101&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=d80977f9d45abee7c52043ec20ac0507&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857035333400%29&relpos=5&citeCnt=1&searchTerm=","taskid":"1442076319d76962fb19b1eaac41b40a"}

Researchers aim not only to find events that happen in networks but more importantly to identify and locate events occurring in the real world. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of quadtree - convolutional quadtree (ConvTree) - and demonstrate its advantage compared to the standard quadtree. We also introduce the algorithm for searching events of different scales using geospatial data obtained from social networks. The algorithm is based on statistical analysis of historical data, generation of ConvTrees representing the normal state of the city and anomalies evaluation for events detection. Experimental study conducted on the dataset of 60 million geotagged Instagram posts in the New York City area demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to find a wide range of events from very local (indie band concert or wedding party) to city (baseball game or holiday march) and even country scale (political protest or Christmas) events. This opens up a perspective of building a simple and fast yet powerful system for real-time multiscale events monitoring. © 2018 ACM.","scival":"99.293","badges":["Convolution","Event detection","Geographic information systems","Geogrids","Monitoring","Quadtree","Social media","Spatial data","Convolution","Geographic information systems","Geosynthetic materials","Monitoring","Event detection","Geogrids","Quad trees","Social media","Spatial data","Data mining"],"publicationTitle":null,"journalInfo":["Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Analytics for Local Events and News, LENS 2018","6 November 2018, Номер статьи 1","2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Analytics for Local Events and News, LENS 2018; Seattle; United States; 6 November 2018 до 6 November 2018; Код 142596"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56644935700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85058984035","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57035333400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85058984035","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56316768900&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85058984035","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56086498600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85058984035","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6603474810&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85058984035"],"ctime":1581094221,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058984035&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=d80977f9d45abee7c52043ec20ac0507&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857035333400%29&relpos=6&citeCnt=2&searchTerm=","taskid":"5eeb11108560fa963845507db5bbee56"}

Diversity of interests leads to the emergence of a variety of crawling techniques and programming solutions. Nevertheless, these solutions have a lack of flexibility to satisfy requirements of different users and individual crawling scenarios, that can range from a simple query to a complex workflow containing multiple steps and requiring data from different networks to be collected. To address this problem, our paper proposes an approach based on a developed domain specific language (DSL) and architecture of distributed crawling system. The DSL has a declarative style that requires the user to define the description of needed data and based on an ontological model of social networks and the essential crawling techniques. Thus, the crawling system can be applied to collect the data from different online social networks within complex workflows along with the exploitation of various crawling methods implemented in a distributed computing environment. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","scival":"78.200","badges":["Crawling","Domain-specific language","Ontology","Social media","Social networks","Complex networks","Data acquisition","Data handling","Digital subscriber lines","Ontology","Problem oriented languages","Social networking (online)","Social sciences computing","Crawling","Distributed computing environment","Domain specific language (DSL)","Domain specific languages","On-line social networks","Ontological modeling","Programming solutions","Social media","Distributed computer systems"],"publicationTitle":"Journal of Intelligent Information Systems","journalInfo":["Journal of Intelligent Information Systems","Volume 51, Issue 2, 1 October 2018, Pages 389-414",""],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Birzhevaya 4, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218218400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85053276870","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192819264&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85053276870","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57035333400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85053276870","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56086498600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85053276870","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55382199400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85053276870"],"ctime":1581094225,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053276870&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=d80977f9d45abee7c52043ec20ac0507&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857035333400%29&relpos=7&citeCnt=5&searchTerm=","taskid":"016a8f597dc92e42baca1295562598cb"}

Born and raised in the digital era, Russian students of the 21st century are seduced by entertainment and in contrast they perceive STEM educational activities as boring and annoying. To spark an interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) programming we decided to implement a competitive contest in the educational process. By combining the developments of the eScience Research Institute and educational techniques, we have introduced elements of entertainment to a group project of 6 ECTS during the second semester of the Double Degree Master's Program in Computational Science. The main goal of this project is to teach students basics of AI programming by creating bots for a strategy video game. Typical tasks and multi-domain specificity stimulate students to discover and apply new information from available sources promoting the principles of self-education and lifelong learning. An exaggerated and concentrated example of diverse behavioral patterns in the game should help students to transfer the patterns acquired from the games to solve real-life problems.","scival":"71.320","badges":["Artificial intelligence","Competitive programming","Game development","Gamedev","Turn-based strategy","Artificial intelligence","Education","Human computer interaction","Interactive computer graphics","Software design","Behavioral patterns","Computational science","Educational activities","Educational process","Game development","Gamedev","Life long learning","Research institutes","Students"],"publicationTitle":null,"journalInfo":["Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning","Volume 2015-January, 2015, Pages 66-74",""],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218377500&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84955060133","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218197100&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84955060133","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57035333400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84955060133","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57214419375&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84955060133","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217613800&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84955060133"],"ctime":1581094294,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955060133&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=d80977f9d45abee7c52043ec20ac0507&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857035333400%29&relpos=24&citeCnt=1&searchTerm=","taskid":"58e1499369788631199165c729558df8"}

Scheduling is one of the main components for optimizing the operation of the computing system. Currently, there are a large number of scheduling algorithms. However, even in spite of existing hybrid schemes, there remains a need for a scheduling scheme that can quickly and efficiently solve a scheduling problem on a wide range of possible states of the computing environment, including the high heterogeneity of computational models and resources, and should have an ability to self-adapt and self-learn. At present, artificial intelligence and neural networks are the most popular methods for working with data and solving a wide range of problems, but they are not developed enough to solve the scheduling problem.

This leads more and more often to the need to use high-performance computational clusters, such as supercomputers. Created multi-agent simulation applications require not only significant resources but often perform time-consuming complex scenarios, which significantly affects the efficiency of the executed process. However, there are various mechanisms for optimizing application execution for different needs. Unfortunately, the specificity of multi-agent simulation does not allow the use of traditional and modern algorithms due to the iteratively variable workload and limitations of a system software installed on the supercomputers. In this paper, we propose a four-level scheme for organizing the symbiotic execution (co-design) of multi-agent applications on supercomputers, as well as an effective two-level algorithm for optimizing the flow of the execution of an urban mobility simulation application.

It means that a scientist from physics, biology or even sociology should struggle with all technical issues on the way of building distributed multi-scale application supported by a stack of specific technologies on high-performance clusters. As the result, created applications have partly implemented logic and are extremely inefficient in execution. In this paper, we present an approach which takes away the user from the necessity to care about an efficient resolving of imbalance of computations being performed in different processes and on different scales of his application. The efficient balance of internal workload in distributed and multi-scale applications may be achieved by introducing: a special multi-level model; a contract (or domain-specific language) to formulate the application in terms of this model; and a scheduler which operates on top of that model. The multi-level model consists of computing routines, computational resources and executed processes, determines a mapping between them and serves as a mean to evaluate the resulting performance of the whole application and its individual parts. The contract corresponds to unification interface of application integration in the proposed framework while the scheduling algorithm optimizes the execution process taking into consideration the main computational environment aspects. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","scival":"89.206","badges":["Distributed computing","HPC","MPI","Multi-agent modeling","Multi-scale applications","Optimization","Computer aided software engineering","Distributed computer systems","Multi agent systems","Optimization","Problem oriented languages","Scheduling algorithms","Application integration","Computational environments","Computational resources","Distributed applications","Domain specific languages","High performance cluster","Multi-Agent Model","Multi-scale","Computation theory"],"publicationTitle":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","journalInfo":["Communications in Computer and Information Science","Volume 965, 2019, Pages 675-686","4th Russian Supercomputing Days Conference, RuSCDays 2018; Moscow; Russian Federation; 24 September 2018 до 25 September 2018; Код 222689"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation\nLobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Federation\nResearch Computing Center of Moscow State University, Moscow, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56086498600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218218400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57014741500&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56644935700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57205408722&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57189293745&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56992702500&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57035333400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148"],"ctime":1581094306,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059904148&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=d0d8fbc2b06719e2ec4f1e587bd75d99&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857014741500%29&relpos=2&citeCnt=1&searchTerm=","taskid":"37e07e3a910b3c834ed37f855313fad4"}

One of retailing data analytics applications is the construction of recommendation system. Increase the quality of the recommendation system is possible when analyzing a larger amount of data, which can be obtained from external heterogeneous sources. Examples of sources for data integration can be data from online and offline markets inside one company or data from partner companies. Within one market area, a range of offered products may be similar, while the characteristics or associative rules formed for them may differ. Therefore, for the correct integration of external data sources into the existing recommendation system, it is required to analyze the structure and content of additional data sources to use only beneficial parts of that data.

However, the volume of data and complexity of their processing is growing extremely fast, which poses new challenges and tasks for developing new tools and methods for improving the efficiency of streaming data processing. One of the main ways to improve a system performance is an effective scheduling and a proper configuration of the computing platform. Running large-scale streaming applications, especially in the clouds, requires a high cost of computing resources and additional efforts to deploy and support an application itself. Thus, there is a need for an opportunity to estimate the performance of the system and its behaviour before real calculations are made. Therefore, in this work we propose a model for distributed data stream processing, stream scheduling problem statement and a developed simulator of the streaming platform, immediately allowing to explore the behaviour of the system under various conditions.

The proposed makespan estimation algorithm can be integrated easily into a wide class of schedulers as a separate module. We use a dual stochastic representation, characteristic/distribution function, in order to combine task estimates into the overall workflow makespan. Additionally, we propose the workflow reductions—operations on a workflow graph that do not decrease the accuracy of the estimates but simplify the graph structure, hence increasing the performance of the algorithm.

Moreover, performance models, which are used for the estimation of obtained solutions, are crucial parts of workflow scheduling. In this work we present a combined approach for automatic parameters tuning and performance models construction in the background of the WMS lifecycle.

In such environments, traditionally, one of the most frequently used mechanisms of computational organization is the Workflow approach. Taking into account new technological advantages, such as resources virtualization, we propose new coevolution approaches for workflow scheduling problem. The approach is based on metaheuristic coevolution that evolves several diverse populations that influence each other with final positive effect. Besides traditional population, that optimizes tasks execution order and task's map to the computational resources, additional populations are used to change computational environment to gain more efficient optimization. As a result, proposed scheduling algorithm optimizes both computation tasks to computation environment and computation environment to computation tasks, making final execution process more efficient than traditional approaches can provide.

For the demonstration of the efficiency of surrogate-assisted multi-fidelity approach, it was compared with the baseline evolutionary calibration approach. The second advantage was assured by additional increasing of optimisation quality in the presence of strict deadline due to the building the strategy of multi-fidelity fitness approximation directly during the evolutionary algorithm execution. In order to prove the efficiency of the proposed dynamic strategy, it was compared with the preliminary meta-optimisation approach. As a case study, the wind wave model SWAN is used.

Extreme metocean events forecasting and prevention is an urgent computing task from decision-making and for reaction point of view.

Many of these tasks should be executed during the overall lifecycle of hazard prevention system that includes not only urgent scenario but research part, as well In this paper, we decompose all tasks in three groups by most significant computational aspects (taking into consideration different criteria of data processing and high-performance contributions) and suggest a new solution that is adaptable for both research in normal (non-urgent) and urgent computing modes, where potential tasks can be structured in the form of scenarios.

The case studies describe three scenarios with proposed infrastructure features that are the most interesting for highlighting relevant problems of metocean simulations within the Baltic Sea.

Often, during the simulation different types of artifacts can appear due to the inappropriate model tuning or errors in boundary and initial data and, therefore, expert's supervision and validation are required. When the number of images is increasing it becomes difficult or even impossible to check all output images manually. Therefore, it is required to use machine learning algorithms to reduce a time for expert's validation. Thereby, it would be useful to develop a system that allows detecting anomalies in generated data automatically during the experiment. In the paper, we provide a method of anomalies detection for the geospatial data. Data in climatographic archives is available in restricted amount and therefore, full Arctic images are divided into sub-zones, which allows one to increase training set. Moreover, this division can be used to account for the spatial dependency, which is required for ice images. An advantage of the approach is the ability to detect anomalies completely in automatic mode without involving a domain expert and manual labeling. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"99.989","badges":["anomalies detection","convolutional neural networks","ice modelling","machine learning","metocean","sea ice","Convolution","Learning algorithms","Learning systems","Machine learning","Neural networks","Sea ice","Automatic mode","Computational power","Convolutional neural network","Domain experts","Geo-spatial data","Manual labeling","Metocean","Spatial dependencies","Anomaly detection"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 321-330","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, 49 Kronverksky pr., St Petersburg, 197101, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57207451668&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062534297","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56088330100&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062534297","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218089100&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062534297"],"ctime":1581094410,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062534297&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=2d202399f7aba5cdaf6a3e8460c70d4f&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856218089100%29&relpos=8&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"473e3105a7d3b2c2bfc394828a049fa5"}

However, enhanced modeling and simulation require integration of various data and knowledge sources, models of various kinds (data-driven models, numerical models, simulation models, etc.), and intelligent components in one composite solution. Growing complexity of such composite model leads to the need of specific approaches for management of such model. This need extends where the model itself becomes a complex system. One of the important aspects of complex model management is dealing with the uncertainty of various kinds (context, parametric, structural, and input/output) to control the model. In the situation where a system being modeled, or modeling requirements change over time, specific methods and tools are needed to make modeling and application procedures (metamodeling operations) in an automatic manner. To support automatic building and management of complex models we propose a general evolutionary computation approach which enables managing of complexity and uncertainty of various kinds. The approach is based on an evolutionary investigation of model phase space to identify the best model’s structure and parameters.

Although, more advanced methods exist, e.g. variational analysis, this technique is widely used among different areas including meteorology and oceanography. Meteorological fields possess spatial inhomogeneity so as the quality of available measurements can vary between locations. This affects efficiency of the correction scheme and consequently motivates the need for adaptive choice of the correction parameters. In this paper we study how the ridge regularization influences the EnOI outcomes regarding statistical measures of fit between corrected and measured time series. Our numerical experiments for the wind field in southwestern Arctic region show that the optimal values of regularization parameter change from one group of observation points to another. We found also that these groups can be identified by clustering analysis based on estimated mutual covariances between time series of the observation points.

The main goal of the chosen strategy is to highlight the most significant ways of uncertainty propagation and to collocate blocks of action with procedures for reduction or evaluation of uncertainty in a way that catches the major part of model error. Blocks of action involve several procedures: calibration of models, data assimilation, ensemble forecasts, and various techniques for residual uncertainty evaluation (including risk evaluation).

The first class analyzes feasible flood damage in the conditions when the barrier system has inoperable state and therefore there is no way to control flood flowing. In this case we use historical data and assessment methods based on principles of extreme value theory. Also for predicted flood that might happen in the nearest time we execute an ensemble on variable input atmospheric data to estimate uncertainty of prediction models. The second class is connected with assessment of produced plans for sluice gate maneuvering. In this case flood evolvement can be controlled. Technical characteristics of the barrier system, model forecast and procedures of plan elaboration add uncertainty in final proposal for making decision phase. Thus the risk assessments also based on ensemble techniques can be useful to decrease possibility of unsafe plan selection.

The dataset is based on the qualitative interviews with 70 drug users and the survey within 80 experts of federal drug control service in St.Petersburg obtained in the course of 2015. A behavioural pattern is considered as a sequence of typical states occurring during the deviation career of a drug user described by certain psycho-physiological characteristics. It is argued that the transitions between these states are not always linearly determined, but rather depend upon desires and motivations of the drug user, which in turn depend on a variety of personal, environmental, and social factors. Based on the empirical data we define basic states and probabilities of transitions between them. Then we build an information model of basic algorithms of narcotization process which can be used for forecasting drug addiction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Urban space forms a much more subtle matter in terms of the simultaneous scale and point of processes spectrum. Certainly, the city is the primary source of generation fundamental anthropogenic factors within the framework of human activity (ecology, transport, society and security). However, on the other hand, in the current realities, it also becomes a structural tools mechanism for creating qualitatively new drivers of development (for example, intelligent infrastructure networks for urban mobility or closed-loop water supply). The city as a dynamic system has a certain set of patterns. The basic ones regulate the system development, complexity of mechanisms and diversification of modules designed. The critical ones regulate system stability and the preservation of existing stable state. Providing modularity of urban management architecture will allow scaling the interaction chain within the socio-technical system (i.e. the city), which make it possible to minimize the risk of destructive strategic decisions. Smart city as a platform provides transparency of the urban space processes and forms a two-level management (citizen-government). An effect indicator of high technology implementation is not so much a formal achievement of indicators values, but as the parameter of the complex infrastructure regime of a certain urban area in a given chronological period. When we have such projects of this level, the citizens themselves act as the center of aggregation of new meanings, values, and needs. On the basis of their everyday life situations, a framework of knowledge is designed for further strategic urban space planning.

We observe that main predictors for food services clusters formation are shops, services and offices, while public spaces (parks and river embankments) do not draw food venues.

In this study the following goal was set: to develop models that allow predicting the location of the user in the next month based on the history of his/her transactions. To achieve this goal an open set of data on debit card transactions in one of the major Russian banks was used. Machine learning techniques such as recurrent neural network (LSTM) and gradient boosting were used for building a model. It was decided to identify different types of travellers before the prediction for getting better results. To measure the effectiveness and compare results of different machine learning methods such metrics as Precision and Recall were used. During the experiments three clusters of users with different travel patterns were obtained.

In particular, Merchant Category Codes of transactions are employed to divide customers into three classes: (1) car drivers; (2) public transport users; (3) mixed. The correctness of the classification is verified by two statistical tests. Also, two metrics, Diversity and Loyalty, are calculated for all customers based on transactions' payment amounts. Customers in each of three classes are additionally grouped by values of these two metrics. The obtained results can be used by banks, e.g., to target advertising. Using the described approach, two data sets were analyzed, each of which contains transactions of bank customers of a large Russian bank. For the second data set, the classification of customers was used in application to the problem of optimizing bank branches network. It turned out, that customers from the first two classes visit top-5 most geoavailable branches with comparable frequency (about 80%), while for customers from the mixed class that value is 70%.

Sometimes values of attributes are missing due to security reasons or problematic data collection process. In this case, the information about connections between vertices become more important since it explicitly allows for using the structure of a social graph for inferring missing attributes. One of the general and effective approaches of inferring missing attributes on graph structures are statistical relational learning. For machine learning tasks, the graph embeddings represent topological properties better, but they are not aimed at the attributes prediction. In this study, we introduce a method combining graph embeddings and the statistical relational learning. We consider different their combinations, as there are possible different hidden connections between social ties and considered attributes. We compare the performance using real data from the social network with different missing attributes and assortative patterns: gender, age, and economic status.

For example, you can personalize offers based on forecasting customer needs, by predicting the expected time and category of next purchase taking into account the transaction history of a customer. One of the approach to make a predictive and generative model for this task is temporal point processes, which is widely used to make predictions of random events. The problem that comes with building such models is that while learning on a set of clients the resulting model generalizes the behavior of all sources and makes the averaged predictions such that we lose any individuality of a client that we make a prediction on. In this study, we propose the models, based on the temporal point processes framework with some ideas to solve the issue described earlier - first is to learn on different activity populations, and the second is based on model individual scaling.

To support automatic building and management of complex models we propose a general evolutionary computation approach based on an evolutionary investigation of model phase space to identify the best model's structure and parameters. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","scival":"79.619","badges":["Complex systems","Data mining","Machine learning","Modeling","Simulation","Uncertainty management","Calculations","Data mining","Large scale systems","Learning systems","Models","Object oriented programming","Phase space methods","Uncertainty analysis","Automatic buildings","Composite modeling","Intelligent components","Knowledge sources","Model and simulation","Natural phenomena","Simulation","Uncertainty management","Information management"],"publicationTitle":null,"journalInfo":["GECCO 2018 Companion - Proceedings of the 2018 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion","6 July 2018, Pages 255-256","2018 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, GECCO 2018; Kyoto; Japan; 15 July 2018 до 19 July 2018; Код 137917"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55382199400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85051564914","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57200526931&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85051564914","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57200213601&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85051564914","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192818747&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85051564914","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192820292&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85051564914","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218089100&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85051564914","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57205104761&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85051564914","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217679300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85051564914"],"ctime":1581094602,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051564914&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=7cc449b14a0c85a9e432e59023010630&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856217679300%29&relpos=12&citeCnt=1&searchTerm=","taskid":"012a80b6966f42e08ea4b74fd7576002"}

We discuss the topical structures of ICCS, and show how these topics have evolved over time in response to the topicality of various domains, technologies and methods, and how all these topics relate to one another. This analysis illustrates the multidisciplinary research and collaborations among scientific communities, by constructing static and dynamic networks from the topic modelling results and from the authors’ keywords. The results of this study provide insights regarding the past and future trends of core discussion topics in computational science and show how “computational thinking” has propagated across different fields of study. We used the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic modelling algorithm to discover topics. The resulting topics were then manually labelled and grouped hierarchically on three levels. Next, we applied trend analysis and Change Point Analysis (CPA) to study the evolution of topics over seventeen years and to identify the growing and disappearing topics. We used Gephi to examine the static networks of topics, and an R library called DyA to analyse the dynamic networks of topics. We also analysed the conference as a platform for potential collaboration development through the perspective of collaboration networks. The results show that authors of ICCS papers continue to actively collaborate after the conference − on average authors collaborate with three other ICCS authors, − which suggests that ICCS is a valuable platform for collaboration development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","scival":"99.165","badges":["Collaboration networks","Computational science","Graph theory","ICCS","Natural language processing","Topic modelling","Computation theory","Factorization","Matrix algebra","Modeling languages","Natural language processing systems","Collaboration network","Computational science","Computational thinkings","ICCS","Multi-disciplinary research","Nonnegative matrix factorization","Publication activities","Topic modelling","Graph theory"],"publicationTitle":"Journal of Computational Science","journalInfo":["Journal of Computational Science","Volume 26, May 2018, Pages 193-204",""],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Russian Federation\nUniversity of Amsterdam, Netherlands\nEötvös University, Hungary","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190224801&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55382199400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217679300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57195350597&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56644935700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57204250277&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=8385944600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57202586742&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85046377224"],"ctime":1581094606,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046377224&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=7cc449b14a0c85a9e432e59023010630&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856217679300%29&relpos=13&citeCnt=4&searchTerm=","taskid":"480599f6eea3a5e13e13918b4c6a3e1c"}

Different business entities can analyze in more detail the behavior of the audience and adapt their products and services to its needs. Social network data allow not only to find the influential individuals according to their local topological properties, but also to investigate their preferences, and thus to personalize strategies of interaction with opinion leaders. However, information channels of organizations (e.g., community of a bank in a social network) include not only target audience but also employees and fake accounts. This lowers the applicability of network-based methods of identifying influential nodes. In this study, we propose an algorithm of discovering influential nodes which combines topological metrics with the individual characteristics of users’ profiles and measures of their activities. The algorithm is used along with preliminary clustering procedure, which is aimed at the identification of groups of users with different roles, and with the algorithm of profiling the interests of users according to their subscriptions. The applicability of approach is tested using the data from a community of large Russian bank in the vk.com social network.

A stochastic Kronecker graph (SKG) is a network generative model that allows reproducing real-world networks while keeping their important topological properties. When sizes of SKGs reach dozens of millions of nodes, there is a need to apply parallel computations to simulate processes on networks stored in a distributed manner. In general, parallel simulation of a dynamical process on a complex network implies all-to-all communication between subnetworks at each iteration. In this paper, we study the efficiency of different SKG partitioning algorithms and different data interchange algorithms for dynamical process simulation on large SKGs. We compare the theoretical efficiency given by parallel performance models with experimental results for different communication patterns. An experimental part of the study was carried out for sparse SKGs with a size up to one billion nodes using Lomonosov supercomputer (Moscow State University, Russian Federation).

On the one hand, we must take into account the features of post and information sources, on the other hand, it is necessary to understand how users react to posts. Moreover, social networks (as well as some natural and technical systems) allow for collecting the data about the actual state of a dynamical process, thus providing the input data for assimilation within the simulation. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent approach for predicting the dissemination of information taking into account both retrospective data and information about the states of the agents within a social network at the current moment. During simulation process, the model receives network state data in form of batches and can modify internal parameters for more accurate prediction. The parallel realization of this approach allows to perform simulation at a reasonable time. The results show that the accuracy of prediction may be significantly improved using additional information collected from an online social network. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"99.402","badges":["forecasting","information spread","parallel algorithm","social network","Forecasting","Multi agent systems","Parallel algorithms","Data and information","Information sources","information spread","Information spreading","Multi-agent approach","On-line social networks","Parallel realizations","Sources of informations","Social networking (online)"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 228-235","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, 49 Kronverksky pr., St Petersburg, 197101, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57195347448&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190225059&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192819264&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217679300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286"],"ctime":1581094639,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062510286&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=7cc449b14a0c85a9e432e59023010630&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856217679300%29&relpos=21&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"7cd4945b8fc90829117ba7d3a0e7d7a6"}

Nevertheless, recent research does not contain enough detail about the particularities of thematic communities formation, or about the topological properties of underlying friendship networks. To address this gap, in this study we analyze structure of communities of different types, namely, carders, commercial sex workers, substance sellers and users, people with radical political views, and compare them to the ‘normal’ communities (without a single narrow focus). We discovered that in contrast to ordinary communities which have positive assortativity (as expected for social networks), specific thematical communities are significantly disassortative. Types of anomalous communities also differ not only in content but in structure.

Most of the existing models (aggregated as SIR-like or network-based as independent cascades) use the assumption of homogeneity of an audience. However, to make a model plausible for a description of real-world processes and to measure the accumulated impact of information on individuals, one needs to personalize the characteristics of users as well as sources of information. In this paper, we propose an approach to data-driven simulation of information spread in social networks which combines a set of different models in a unified framework. It includes a model of a user (including sub-models of reaction and daily activity), a model of message generation by information source and a model of message transfer within a user network. The parameters of models (e.g. for different types of agents) are identified by data from the largest Russian social network vk.com. For this study, we collected the network of users associated with charity community (~33.7 million nodes). To tackle with huge size of networks, we implemented parallel version of modeling framework and tested it on the Lomonosov supercomputer.

However, enhanced modeling and simulation require integration of various data and knowledge sources, models of various kinds (data-driven models, numerical models, simulation models, etc.), and intelligent components in one composite solution. Growing complexity of such composite model leads to the need of specific approaches for management of such model. This need extends where the model itself becomes a complex system. One of the important aspects of complex model management is dealing with the uncertainty of various kinds (context, parametric, structural, and input/output) to control the model. In the situation where a system being modeled, or modeling requirements change over time, specific methods and tools are needed to make modeling and application procedures (metamodeling operations) in an automatic manner. To support automatic building and management of complex models we propose a general evolutionary computation approach which enables managing of complexity and uncertainty of various kinds. The approach is based on an evolutionary investigation of model phase space to identify the best model’s structure and parameters.

To simulate a temporal interbank network, it is necessary to set an initial state and an evolution law for the topology and system entities. Because of the complex interplay between the network topology and the bank states, the stability of a temporal interbank network is generally unpredictable, even if all parameters and rules of interactions are known. In this paper, we present a simulation tool for temporal interbank networks aimed at exploring the different drivers contributing to evolutionary dynamics of banking networks. We describe a general-simulation scheme for temporal interbank networks and incorporate the creation and rewiring of edges because of the counter-party choices with the deletion of nodes and edges in case of a bank default. An example of the implementation of the general scheme is also presented and include models of banks and customers, strategies of counter-party choice, and clearing algorithms. To perform a qualitative and quantitative study of the evolutionary process, the proposed simulation tool supports the calculation of different topological and stability metrics and visualization of network evolution. The experimental study demonstrates (i) an illustrative example of the application of the simulation tool for synthetic networks while varying the counter-party choice policies and parameters of nodes and edges, and (ii) an investigation of the computational complexity and scalability of the simulation scheme. © 2017, University of Surrey.

Using the statistics from multiple runs, one can accurately estimate task execution and communication times to apply static scheduling algorithms. Several workflows with known estimates could be combined into a set to improve the resulting schedule. In this paper, we consider the mapping of multiple workflows to partially available heterogeneous resources. The problem is how to fill free time windows with tasks from different workflows, taking into account users' requirements of the urgency of the results of calculations. To estimate quality of schedules for several workflows with various soft deadlines, we introduce the unified metric incorporating levels of meeting constraints and fairness of resource distribution. The main goal of the work was to develop a set of algorithms implementing different scheduling strategies for multiple workflows with soft deadlines in a non-dedicated environment, and to perform a comparative analysis of these strategies. We study how time restrictions (given by resource providers and users) influence the quality of schedules, and which scheme of grouping and ordering the tasks is the most effective for the batched scheduling of non-urgent workflows. Experiments with several types of synthetic and domain-specific sets of multiple workflows show that: (i) the use of information about time windows and deadlines leads to the significant increase of the quality of static schedules, (ii) the clustering-based scheduling scheme outperforms task-based and workflow-based schemes.

Proposed algorithm combines the modeling of spreading of a process with the generation of vertices and edges which are involved in it.

Dynamical processes in a network affect topological changes at each iteration, so differences in initial topologies may result in different stability dynamics. Taking into account the influence of both nodes’ states dynamics and topology dynamics on the network fragility, the following ways of initial topology impact can be distinguished: (i) states of nodes after initialization (as a state of a node is influenced by its degree); (ii) nodes’ states dynamics; (iii) systemic risk at the fixed iteration. It seems that coevolution of network topology and states of nodes leads to the significant and unpredictable changes of initial conditions. We study the interrelations between initial and resulting system’s states for different types of initial topology.

If we consider a scientist to be a set of his or her publications we can get the vector for a scientist as a weighted sum of a vector of his or her publications.

RO and professionals can be evaluated on the basis of keywords in relevant scientific papers, reports, surveys, proposals, CVs, and so on. The transdisciplinary effect is apparent when the interdisciplinarity distribution has been changed. We propose formulas to evaluate this transdisciplinary effect. This approach was implemented using participants in group projects at the fourth Young Scientists Conference (YSC)† on High-Performance Computing and Computer Simulation. The accuracy of the interdisciplinary vector of several participants was examined by the survey about their involvement in the team projects.

As real-world systems often operate on the border between order and chaos, algorithms simulating RBN's transition to a critical state are of particular interest. Adaptive RBNs (ARBNs) can evolve towards such a state by rewiring of nodes according to their states on the attractor. Numerical simulation of ARBNs larger than several dozens of nodes is computationally hard due to an enormous growth of attractor lengths and transient periods. In this paper, we propose a GPGPU algorithm for parallel simulation of ARBNs with modified activity-dependent rewiring rule which can be used with any sequential algorithm for attractor's search.

The process to prepare basic information to design a course in STEM follows the following steps: 1. Students must present one paper to classmates in a seminar (student prepopulates and sent to the teacher specially prepared for this purpose form). 2. Based on several papers, students must present different solutions for one problem in the area defined by the teacher, e.g. urban studies.

Combining such workflows into sets could sufficiently improve resulting schedules in terms of fairness and meeting users' constraints.

This approach generalizes commonly used techniques of grouping and ordering of parts of different workflows. We introduce a new scheduling algorithm, MDW-C, for multiple workflows with soft deadlines and compare its effectiveness with task-based and workflow-based algorithms which we proposed earlier in [1]. Experiments with several types of synthetic and domain-specific test data sets showed the superiority of a mixed clustering scheme over task-based and workflow-based schemes.

If the start time and the deadline for each specific workflow are known (for example, if a workflow starts execution according to periodic data coming from the sensors, and its execution should be completed before data acquisition), the problem of multiple deadline-constrained workflows scheduling arises. Taking into account that resource providers can give only restricted access to their computational capabilities, we consider the case when resources are partially available for workflow execution. To address the problem described above, we study the scheduling of deadline-constrained scientific wo rkflows in non-dedicated heterogeneous environment. In this paper, we introduce three scheduling algorithms for mapping the tasks of multiple workflows with different deadlines on the static set of resources with previously known free time windows. Simulation experiments show that scheduling strategies based on a proposed staged scheme give better results than merge-based approach considering all workflows at once. © The Authors.

A behavioural pattern is considered as a sequence of typical states occurring during the deviation career of a drug user described by certain psycho-physiological characteristics. It is argued that the transitions between these states are not always linearly determined, but rather depend upon desires and motivations of the drug user, which in turn depend on a variety of personal, environmental, and social factors. Based on the empirical data we define basic states and probabilities of transitions between them.

Urban space forms a much more subtle matter in terms of the simultaneous scale and point of processes spectrum. Certainly, the city is the primary source of generation fundamental anthropogenic factors within the framework of human activity (ecology, transport, society and security). However, on the other hand, in the current realities, it also becomes a structural tools mechanism for creating qualitatively new drivers of development (for example, intelligent infrastructure networks for urban mobility or closed-loop water supply). The city as a dynamic system has a certain set of patterns. The basic ones regulate the system development, complexity of mechanisms and diversification of modules designed. The critical ones regulate system stability and the preservation of existing stable state. Providing modularity of urban management architecture will allow scaling the interaction chain within the socio-technical system (i.e. the city), which make it possible to minimize the risk of destructive strategic decisions. Smart city as a platform provides transparency of the urban space processes and forms a two-level management (citizen-government). An effect indicator of high technology implementation is not so much a formal achievement of indicators values, but as the parameter of the complex infrastructure regime of a certain urban area in a given chronological period. When we have such projects of this level, the citizens themselves act as the center of aggregation of new meanings, values, and needs. On the basis of their everyday life situations, a framework of knowledge is designed for further strategic urban space planning.

Many assumptions in an urban science may be made by analysing traffic flows and vehicle behaviour on city streets. Since road traffic is a dynamic and possibly spatially large system that depends on many external conditions, approaches like visual analysis and computational steering may be used. There are many traffic modelling frameworks presented in the field, but there are also several drawbacks most of them have: they are limited to a specific model or case; have abstracted logic which disregards some factors affecting vehicle movement; they ignore possible physical interactions which are not described in a model or use too many simplifications in vehicle interaction simulations. In this paper, a novel agent-based traffic modelling framework is presented, combining different classes of traffic models into a single vehicle agent and allowing the user to set a specific model for each supported class. The framework was made using a game engine, Unreal Engine 4, which allows users to model realistic interaction between vehicles and make realistic visualisations for purposes of visual analysis and computational steering. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"99.059","badges":["agent-based modelling","car-following models","scientific visualization","Traffic modelling","Autonomous agents","Computation theory","Computational methods","Data visualization","Multi agent systems","Roads and streets","Steering","Traffic control","Visualization","Agent-based modelling","Car following models","Computational steering","External conditions","Physical interactions","Traffic modelling","Traffic simulations","Vehicle interactions","Automobile steering equipment"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 443-452","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192819308&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85060541210","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217925700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85060541210","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218197100&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85060541210"],"ctime":1581094779,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060541210&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=1d1bfbe1c2cfeb556c096d7a37e91743&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856218197100%29&relpos=2&citeCnt=2&searchTerm=","taskid":"2e60fae02138bb477da65b02c6386528"}

Multi-scale processes and connectivity of the urban environment may require interactive visualization of dynamic scenes with lots of objects at different scales. To visualize these scenes it is not always possible to use standard GIS systems.

This paper presents a framework and special algorithms that take full advantage of the GPU to render the urban simulation data over a virtual globe. The experiments on a scalability of the framework have showed that the framework is successfully deals with the visualization of up to two million moving agents and up to eight million of fixed points of interest on top of the virtual globe without detriment to smoothness of the image. © The Authors.

The experiments demonstrated the importance of distinguishing characteristics of different age groups, such as contact intensities and background immunity levels. It was also found that the current model calibration process, which relies mostly on ARI incidence, demonstrates notable variation of output parameter values. Employing additional sources of data, such as strain-specific influenza incidence and external assessments on underreporting levels in different age groups, might enhance the plausibility of parameter values obtained by model calibration, along with reducing the assessment variation. © 2019 The Authors","scival":"96.293","badges":["Background immunity","Incidence data","Mathematical modeling","Seasonal influenza","Article","calibration","disease transmission","epidemic","geographic distribution","groups by age","immunity","incidence","influenza","priority journal","respiratory tract infection","Russian Federation","statistical model"],"publicationTitle":"EpidemicsОткрытый доступ","journalInfo":["EpidemicsОткрытый доступ","Volume 29, December 2019, Номер статьи 100358",""],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation\nRTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, United States","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=31767480200&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85075661365","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6507634452&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85075661365"],"ctime":1581094859,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075661365&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=c3b16162a12ebee3dc56f4a0f2eba493&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2831767480200%29&relpos=0&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"23c170dabdc252213e9b5a6775e72f65"}

Our vector-borne disease model hinges on a metaphorical urn from which PWIDs draw syringes at random which may or may not be infected and may or may not result in one of the two agents becoming infected. The model's parameters are estimated with data mostly from the city of Omsk in Western Siberia. A linear trend in PWID prevalence in Omsk could only be fitted by considering a time-dependent version of the model captured through a secular decrease in the probability that PWIDs decide to share a syringe. A global sensitivity analysis is performed with 14 parameters considered random variables in order to assess their impact on average numbers infected over a 50-year projection. With obvious intervention implications the drug injection rate and the probability of syringe-cleansing are the only parameters whose coefficients of correlations with numbers of infected PWIDs and infected syringes have an absolute value close to or larger than 0.40. © The authors 2016.

The models under study were created by coupling compartmental and discrete-event submodels. The former is responsible for the simulation of the demographic processes in a population while the latter deals with a disease progression for a certain individual. The number and type of components used in a model may vary depending on the research aims and data availability. The introduced high performance approaches are based on batch random number generation, distribution of simulation runs and the calculations on graphical processor units. The emphasis was made on the possibility to use the approaches for various model types without considerable code refactoring for every particular model. The speedup gained was measured on simulation programs written in C++ and MATLAB for the models of HIV and tuberculosis spread and the models of tumor screening for the prevention of colorectal cancer.

For the demonstration of the efficiency of surrogate-assisted multi-fidelity approach, it was compared with the baseline evolutionary calibration approach. The second advantage was assured by additional increasing of optimisation quality in the presence of strict deadline due to the building the strategy of multi-fidelity fitness approximation directly during the evolutionary algorithm execution. In order to prove the efficiency of the proposed dynamic strategy, it was compared with the preliminary meta-optimisation approach. As a case study, the wind wave model SWAN is used.

Often, during the simulation different types of artifacts can appear due to the inappropriate model tuning or errors in boundary and initial data and, therefore, expert's supervision and validation are required. When the number of images is increasing it becomes difficult or even impossible to check all output images manually. Therefore, it is required to use machine learning algorithms to reduce a time for expert's validation. Thereby, it would be useful to develop a system that allows detecting anomalies in generated data automatically during the experiment. In the paper, we provide a method of anomalies detection for the geospatial data.

This data can be used to solve various user profiling tasks that involve classifiers construction. State-of-the-art NLP models, despite their superior performance, still require manually labelled train and test datasets of significant, however, reduced size. The labelling with the help of user assessors may be impeded by the task complexity or lack of financial or time resources.

Thus, comes the natural assumption that the way of how user prefers to live offline affects the content of his/her internet profile. Having a possibility to evaluate and interpret the available set of features in order to get the notion of the user preferences in daily actions will be beneficial for many stakeholders. When trying to search for the features that define lifestyle it is vital to formalize this phenomenon in terms of social media. Here, we assess lifestyle as the set of specific user interests, descriptions of direct actions (activities) and their degree of manifestation for a particular user. Such definition, combined with division on 5 activity domains (sport and health, culture and religion, work and family, entertainments and leisure, general activities), makes possible to introduce the way to measure lifestyle as the set of performed activities that can be uncovered using topic modeling. In order to measure lifestyle, the paper proposes a two - level topic modeling approach of extraction, where the crucial part of the approach is to ensure the quality of resulting topics and to choose their proper number. The latter requires a comparative study of topic quality assessment methods for further usage, which has been done in the paper. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"98.431","badges":["Activity Extraction","Lifestyle Assessment","Social Media","Topic Modelling","Extraction","Quality of service","Social networking (online)","Comparative studies","Daily actions","Implicit features","Lifestyle Assessment","Quality assessment","Social media","Topic Modeling","User interests","Data mining"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 236-245","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, 49 Kronverksky pr., St Petersurg, 197101, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57207458742&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062542052","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218218400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062542052"],"ctime":1581094949,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062542052&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=a5cfb380cb235567123e098df45dc23f&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857207458742%29&relpos=1&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"45982e2ec683e630b39e78e7f46e3499"}

Sometimes values of attributes are missing due to security reasons or problematic data collection process.

One of the general and effective approaches of inferring missing attributes on graph structures are statistical relational learning. For machine learning tasks, the graph embeddings represent topological properties better, but they are not aimed at the attributes prediction. In this study, we introduce a method combining graph embeddings and the statistical relational learning. We consider different their combinations, as there are possible different hidden connections between social ties and considered attributes. We compare the performance using real data from the social network with different missing attributes and assortative patterns: gender, age, and economic status.

These stages are related not only to a frequency of transactions but also to a range of adopted purchase categories. Given the history of transactions, one can identify for a user to which cluster (in terms of similar purchase interests) he or she belongs, and, thus, to refine probabilities of purchases in different categories. Moreover, possible trajectories of a user in a state space may be additionally tuned using the information about his or her socioeconomic strata. In this study, we consider a problem of purchase categories prediction from the perspective of state-transition modeling.

However, enhanced modeling and simulation require integration of various data and knowledge sources, models of various kinds (data-driven models, numerical models, simulation models, etc.), and intelligent components in one composite solution. Growing complexity of such composite model leads to the need of specific approaches for management of such model. This need extends where the model itself becomes a complex system. One of the important aspects of complex model management is dealing with the uncertainty of various kinds (context, parametric, structural, and input/output) to control the model. In the situation where a system being modeled, or modeling requirements change over time, specific methods and tools are needed to make modeling and application procedures (metamodeling operations) in an automatic manner. To support automatic building and management of complex models we propose a general evolutionary computation approach which enables managing of complexity and uncertainty of various kinds. The approach is based on an evolutionary investigation of model phase space to identify the best model’s structure and parameters. Examples of different areas (healthcare, hydrometeorology, and social network analysis) were elaborated with the proposed approach and solutions. Copyright © 2018 Sergey V.

It allows using of metrics-based methods with reduced search quality or data-driven methods which also needs a great amount of data. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble-based data-driven method that tries to learn a scoring function by combining independent functions from a predefined set.

It means that a scientist from physics, biology or even sociology should struggle with all technical issues on the way of building distributed multi-scale application supported by a stack of specific technologies on high-performance clusters. As the result, created applications have partly implemented logic and are extremely inefficient in execution. In this paper, we present an approach which takes away the user from the necessity to care about an efficient resolving of imbalance of computations being performed in different processes and on different scales of his application. The efficient balance of internal workload in distributed and multi-scale applications may be achieved by introducing: a special multi-level model; a contract (or domain-specific language) to formulate the application in terms of this model; and a scheduler which operates on top of that model. The multi-level model consists of computing routines, computational resources and executed processes, determines a mapping between them and serves as a mean to evaluate the resulting performance of the whole application and its individual parts. The contract corresponds to unification interface of application integration in the proposed framework while the scheduling algorithm optimizes the execution process taking into consideration the main computational environment aspects. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","scival":"89.206","badges":["Distributed computing","HPC","MPI","Multi-agent modeling","Multi-scale applications","Optimization","Computer aided software engineering","Distributed computer systems","Multi agent systems","Optimization","Problem oriented languages","Scheduling algorithms","Application integration","Computational environments","Computational resources","Distributed applications","Domain specific languages","High performance cluster","Multi-Agent Model","Multi-scale","Computation theory"],"publicationTitle":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","journalInfo":["Communications in Computer and Information Science","Volume 965, 2019, Pages 675-686","4th Russian Supercomputing Days Conference, RuSCDays 2018; Moscow; Russian Federation; 24 September 2018 до 25 September 2018; Код 222689"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation\nLobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Federation\nResearch Computing Center of Moscow State University, Moscow, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56086498600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218218400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57014741500&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56644935700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57205408722&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57189293745&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56992702500&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57035333400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85059904148"],"ctime":1581094999,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059904148&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=2bd96672e9c00d32aec00990efb8544d&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856218218400%29&relpos=3&citeCnt=1&searchTerm=","taskid":"6c6e00cf4a6e8ff3328ac5bb349f9955"}

It is used to understand semantic of texts and opinion of people. There are many practical applications, which require to extract sentiment from texts: advertising analytics, interactive chat bots, opinion mining. Today, different supervised techniques are used to extract sentiment from texts which require large manually labeled datasets that are expensive and time consuming to build. Moreover, such datasets should cover vocabularies and patterns of use of different contexts. Additionally, the efficiency of supervised methods trained on a well-written texts can dramatically decrease on users' texts from social media due to typos, slang, short length of sentences.

Thus, comes the natural assumption that the way of how user prefers to live offline affects the content of his/her internet profile. Having a possibility to evaluate and interpret the available set of features in order to get the notion of the user preferences in daily actions will be beneficial for many stakeholders. When trying to search for the features that define lifestyle it is vital to formalize this phenomenon in terms of social media. Here, we assess lifestyle as the set of specific user interests, descriptions of direct actions (activities) and their degree of manifestation for a particular user. Such definition, combined with division on 5 activity domains (sport and health, culture and religion, work and family, entertainments and leisure, general activities), makes possible to introduce the way to measure lifestyle as the set of performed activities that can be uncovered using topic modeling. In order to measure lifestyle, the paper proposes a two - level topic modeling approach of extraction, where the crucial part of the approach is to ensure the quality of resulting topics and to choose their proper number. The latter requires a comparative study of topic quality assessment methods for further usage, which has been done in the paper. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"98.431","badges":["Activity Extraction","Lifestyle Assessment","Social Media","Topic Modelling","Extraction","Quality of service","Social networking (online)","Comparative studies","Daily actions","Implicit features","Lifestyle Assessment","Quality assessment","Social media","Topic Modeling","User interests","Data mining"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 236-245","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, 49 Kronverksky pr., St Petersurg, 197101, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57207458742&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062542052","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218218400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062542052"],"ctime":1581095015,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062542052&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=2bd96672e9c00d32aec00990efb8544d&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856218218400%29&relpos=7&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"1a6a6e377a48f41f407525f60b439c18"}

However, the volume of data and complexity of their processing is growing extremely fast, which poses new challenges and tasks for developing new tools and methods for improving the efficiency of streaming data processing. One of the main ways to improve a system performance is an effective scheduling and a proper configuration of the computing platform. Running large-scale streaming applications, especially in the clouds, requires a high cost of computing resources and additional efforts to deploy and support an application itself. Thus, there is a need for an opportunity to estimate the performance of the system and its behaviour before real calculations are made. Therefore, in this work we propose a model for distributed data stream processing, stream scheduling problem statement and a developed simulator of the streaming platform, immediately allowing to explore the behaviour of the system under various conditions. In addition, we propose a genetic algorithm for efficient stream scheduling and conducting experimental studies. Copyright © 2018 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

In the last decade the social networks have become an everyday source of information for many people, especially young, and the quality of information about psychology being spread through the networks is of considerable interest to psychologists. The study described aimed to assess academic quality of psychological texts in theme communities, popular with users of the social network \"Vkontakte\". Expert assessment (by young academic psychologists working at research institutes and universities of Moscow and St. Petersburg) helped to identify communities broadcasting academically correct (scientifically proved) and incorrect (not proved scientifically) information about psychology in the network.

It seems to be more flexible and cost-effective as compared to dedicated monitoring systems based on instrumental sensors and surveillance cameras. However, benefitting from these advantages requires deploying fine-tuned approaches to work with rich and voluminous data generated by volunteers or users of social network sites. In this paper, we consider the issue of processing unstructured, distorted and fragmentary textual data produced by the members of the community aimed at sharing experiences and observations of accidents and unusual experiences with the urban environment.

For instance, the process of issuing informational messages in such networks unfolds though multiple stages. Since some networks incorporate networking and media features, actors issuing and spreading messages can be represented by individual users and aggregate entities (communities and interest groups).

This research paper uses this source to investigate one of the most crucial issues for many young Russians – how successful are Russia’s leading universities in the employability rates of their graduates on completion of their studies. Official data from the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation show fairly high rates of employment, but the methodology used gives us little indication of the extent to which their employment corresponds to the professional or occupational specialism they acquired at their university. The analysis with the use of the ‘VKontakte’ network provides significant insight into this question.

Using the statistics from multiple runs, one can accurately estimate task execution and communication times to apply static scheduling algorithms. Several workflows with known estimates could be combined into a set to improve the resulting schedule. In this paper, we consider the mapping of multiple workflows to partially available heterogeneous resources. The problem is how to fill free time windows with tasks from different workflows, taking into account users' requirements of the urgency of the results of calculations. To estimate quality of schedules for several workflows with various soft deadlines, we introduce the unified metric incorporating levels of meeting constraints and fairness of resource distribution. The main goal of the work was to develop a set of algorithms implementing different scheduling strategies for multiple workflows with soft deadlines in a non-dedicated environment, and to perform a comparative analysis of these strategies. We study how time restrictions (given by resource providers and users) influence the quality of schedules, and which scheme of grouping and ordering the tasks is the most effective for the batched scheduling of non-urgent workflows. Experiments with several types of synthetic and domain-specific sets of multiple workflows show that: (i) the use of information about time windows and deadlines leads to the significant increase of the quality of static schedules, (ii) the clustering-based scheduling scheme outperforms task-based and workflow-based schemes. This was confirmed by an evaluation of studied algorithms on a basis of the CLAVIRE workflow management platform. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The cost of missing the deadline in such situations can be unacceptable, while providing insufficient results can mean an ineffective solution that may come at a very high cost. In order to provide a solution that is appropriate under the current conditions (i.e. available volume of computational resources, workload, and time available), a new approach is required. In this paper, we present a schema and algorithm of regulating the volume of computations within an urgent workflow to deliver a solution that is as sufficient as possible given the current conditions and deadline. To achieve these goals, we develop an approach that modifies an urgent workflow by changing its structure and the parameters of its individual tasks. Such modifications are based on introducing a notion of quality and applying quality-based models to estimate the sufficiency of solutions generated by the resulting workflow structures.

In this paper we investigate the applicability of previously developed metaheuristic algorithm - coevolutional genetic algorithm (CGA) for scheduling series of workflows with hard deadlines constraints. © 2015 The Authors.","scival":"98.242","badges":["coevolution","genetic algorithm","grid","HEFT","Scheduling","workflow","Algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Packet networks","Scheduling","Application structure","Co-evolution","Distributed environments","grid","HEFT","Meta heuristic algorithm","Scientific applications","workflow","Scheduling algorithms"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 66, 2015, Pages 506-514","4th International Young Scientist Conference on Computational Science, 2015; Athens; Greece; 25 June 2015 до 25 June 2015; Код 123128"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56644935700&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84962683650","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57014741500&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84962683650","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218218400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84962683650","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56086498600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84962683650"],"ctime":1581095084,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962683650&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=2bd96672e9c00d32aec00990efb8544d&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856218218400%29&relpos=24&citeCnt=8&searchTerm=","taskid":"e5ef2f88cf2cff010af2b02f254c4df8"}

In such environments, traditionally, one of the most frequently used mechanisms of computational organization is the Workflow approach. Taking into account new technological advantages, such as resources virtualization, we propose new coevolution approaches for workflow scheduling problem. The approach is based on metaheuristic coevolution that evolves several diverse populations that influence each other with final positive effect. Besides traditional population, that optimizes tasks execution order and task's map to the computational resources, additional populations are used to change computational environment to gain more efficient optimization. As a result, proposed scheduling algorithm optimizes both computation tasks to computation environment and computation environment to computation tasks, making final execution process more efficient than traditional approaches can provide.

This approach generalizes commonly used techniques of grouping and ordering of parts of different workflows. We introduce a new scheduling algorithm, MDW-C, for multiple workflows with soft deadlines and compare its effectiveness with task-based and workflow-based algorithms which we proposed earlier in [1]. Experiments with several types of synthetic and domain-specific test data sets showed the superiority of a mixed clustering scheme over task-based and workflow-based schemes.

To effectively spread information characteristics of information sources and their positions in the network have to be properly adjusted. Sources play a crucial role as they initiate and support the spreading process. Adjusting sources has a certain cost and thus their non-optimal configuration may lead to wasting resources spent to sources adjusting or even poor performance. In this work, the problem of sources settings and positions optimization is discussed and the framework for solving the problem is proposed. The developed framework incorporates source and spreading models which take into account individual characteristics of sources as characteristics of their positions. The solution can handle all steps which may be required for optimization: network monitoring and data collecting; parameters and settings identification; source layout optimization. The efficiency of solutions generated by the framework with the genetic algorithm adapted for source layout optimization is demonstrated by comparison with greedy heuristic on the dataset collected from Twitter. © 2015 The Authors.","scival":"99.402","badges":["combinatorial optimization","Genetic algorithm","information spreading","SI","social networks","Twitter","Combinatorial optimization","Genetic algorithms","Silicon","Social networking (online)","Greedy heuristics","Individual characteristics","Information sources","Information spreading","Layout optimization","Network Monitoring","Spread of informations","Twitter","Optimization"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 66, 2015, Pages 287-296","4th International Young Scientist Conference on Computational Science, 2015; Athens; Greece; 25 June 2015 до 25 June 2015; Код 123128"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218218400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84962649004","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56780294900&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84962649004","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55382268900&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84962649004","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56451045500&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84962649004","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6603474810&amp;eid=2-s2.0-84962649004"],"ctime":1581095097,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962649004&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=2bd96672e9c00d32aec00990efb8544d&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856218218400%29&relpos=27&citeCnt=5&searchTerm=","taskid":"3822a027733bc534d6ab2b02bf719c8a"}

In this paper, we present an extension of classic OP—Orienteering Problem with Functional Profits (OPFP), where the score of a specific point depends on its characteristics, position in the route, and other points in the route. For solving OPFP, we developed an open-source framework for solving orienteering problems, which utilizes four core components of OP in its modular architecture. Fully-written in Go programming language our framework can be extended for solving different types of tasks with different algorithms; this was demonstrated by implementation of two popular algorithms for OP solving—Ant Colony Optimization and Recursive Greedy Algorithm. Computational efficiency of the framework was shown through solving four well-known OP types: classic Orienteering Problem (OP), Orienteering Problem with Compulsory Vertices (OPCV), Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW), and Time Dependent Orienteering Problem (TDOP) along with OPFP. Experiments were conducted on a large multi-source dataset for Saint Petersburg, Russia, containing data from Instagram, TripAdvisor, Foursquare and official touristic website. Our framework is able to construct touristic paths for different OP types within few seconds using dataset with thousands of points of interest. © 2019 Mukhina et al.

Scheduling is one of the main components for optimizing the operation of the computing system. Currently, there are a large number of scheduling algorithms.

At present, artificial intelligence and neural networks are the most popular methods for working with data and solving a wide range of problems, but they are not developed enough to solve the scheduling problem.

Thus, there is no surprise that in the field of social media analysis the research agenda has moved from the development of event detection methods to a brand new area - event prediction models. This research field is extremely important for all sorts of applications, from natural disasters preparation and criminal activity prevention to urban management and development of smart cities. However, even the leading models have an important disadvantage: they are based on prior knowledge about events being expected. So forecasting systems based on such models are heavily limited by a list of events that can be predicted and all events of other types will be out of systems' scope. In this work, we try to address this issue and propose a deep learning model, which is able to predict an area of the future event in the urban environment. This model is able to predict the future state of the city - a level of users activity in the location-based social network Instagram - with the average deviation from the ground truth of 1%, and achieves 69% recall when solving the events prediction problem. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This leads more and more often to the need to use high-performance computational clusters, such as supercomputers. Created multi-agent simulation applications require not only significant resources but often perform time-consuming complex scenarios, which significantly affects the efficiency of the executed process. However, there are various mechanisms for optimizing application execution for different needs. Unfortunately, the specificity of multi-agent simulation does not allow the use of traditional and modern algorithms due to the iteratively variable workload and limitations of a system software installed on the supercomputers. In this paper, we propose a four-level scheme for organizing the symbiotic execution (co-design) of multi-agent applications on supercomputers, as well as an effective two-level algorithm for optimizing the flow of the execution of an urban mobility simulation application.

As the result, created applications have partly implemented logic and are extremely inefficient in execution. In this paper, we present an approach which takes away the user from the necessity to care about an efficient resolving of imbalance of computations being performed in different processes and on different scales of his application. The efficient balance of internal workload in distributed and multi-scale applications may be achieved by introducing: a special multi-level model; a contract (or domain-specific language) to formulate the application in terms of this model; and a scheduler which operates on top of that model. The multi-level model consists of computing routines, computational resources and executed processes, determines a mapping between them and serves as a mean to evaluate the resulting performance of the whole application and its individual parts.

Extreme metocean events forecasting and prevention is an urgent computing task from decision-making and for reaction point of view. In this case, urgent computing scenario is an essential part that should be included in the hazard simulation and prevention system However, existed urgent computing technological concepts does not perfectly fit all tasks in a frame of extreme metocean events simulation. Many of these tasks should be executed during the overall lifecycle of hazard prevention system that includes not only urgent scenario but research part, as well In this paper, we decompose all tasks in three groups by most significant computational aspects (taking into consideration different criteria of data processing and high-performance contributions) and suggest a new solution that is adaptable for both research in normal (non-urgent) and urgent computing modes, where potential tasks can be structured in the form of scenarios. Suggested solution implements CLAVIRE platform core and extends its with advanced features (regarding simulation frequency, computational performance and data-driven computing). As an example in the metocean subject area, a complex application for Baltic Sea simulations is presented. The case studies describe three scenarios with proposed infrastructure features that are the most interesting for highlighting relevant problems of metocean simulations within the Baltic Sea.

The main disadvantage of existing specialized topologies is a difficulty to implement an efficient data placement that takes into account locality of the data. In scientific problems very often it is necessary to provide the semantic proximity of the data at the nodes of the distributed system. Core drawback of modern consensus protocols is that most of them use messaging through broadcasting, which is impossible for large amounts of data and storage nodes. With more stringent requirements for a fault tolerance, e.g. requirement for resistance to Byzantine errors [1], ensuring of data localization becomes nearly impossible. The purpose of this paper is to implement a distributed consensus protocol that preserves data localization and is resistant to Byzantine errors. Theoretical tasks: a) consider how to implement distributed services based on finite state machines; b) consider how to ensure Byzantine fault tolerance; c) consider methods for organizing the semantic proximity of data. Practical tasks: a) develop ways to jointly ensure the Byzantine fault tolerance and locality of data; b) study the shortcomings of the joint provision of Byzantine fault tolerance and locality of data; c) develop a protocol of Byzantine consensus using semantic links between data; d) analyze the performance of the developed protocol within the framework of applied tasks. The object of the study is a distributed data storage system with the requirement for Byzantine fault tolerance. The subject of this study is the provision of Byzantine fault tolerance in conjunction with the use of semantic links between the data.

Thus, there is a need for an opportunity to estimate the performance of the system and its behaviour before real calculations are made. Therefore, in this work we propose a model for distributed data stream processing, stream scheduling problem statement and a developed simulator of the streaming platform, immediately allowing to explore the behaviour of the system under various conditions. In addition, we propose a genetic algorithm for efficient stream scheduling and conducting experimental studies. Copyright © 2018 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Such composite applications commonly are represented as workflows. Workflow scheduling is a well-known optimization problem, for which there is a great amount of solutions. Most of the algorithms contain parameters, which affect the result of a method. Thus, for the efficient scheduling it is important to tune parameters of the algorithms. Moreover, performance models, which are used for the estimation of obtained solutions, are crucial parts of workflow scheduling. In this work we present a combined approach for automatic parameters tuning and performance models construction in the background of the WMS lifecycle.

When QoS has some restrictions - limited cost or deadline - scheduling becomes even more complicated.

The cost of missing the deadline in such situations can be unacceptable, while providing insufficient results can mean an ineffective solution that may come at a very high cost. In order to provide a solution that is appropriate under the current conditions (i.e. available volume of computational resources, workload, and time available), a new approach is required. In this paper, we present a schema and algorithm of regulating the volume of computations within an urgent workflow to deliver a solution that is as sufficient as possible given the current conditions and deadline. To achieve these goals, we develop an approach that modifies an urgent workflow by changing its structure and the parameters of its individual tasks. Such modifications are based on introducing a notion of quality and applying quality-based models to estimate the sufficiency of solutions generated by the resulting workflow structures. Finally, a special extension of the genetic algorithm that performs quality-based scheduling of urgent workflows is described along with an experimental study to demonstrate its efficacy. © The Authors.

In such environments, traditionally, one of the most frequently used mechanisms of computational organization is the Workflow approach. Taking into account new technological advantages, such as resources virtualization, we propose new coevolution approaches for workflow scheduling problem. The approach is based on metaheuristic coevolution that evolves several diverse populations that influence each other with final positive effect. Besides traditional population, that optimizes tasks execution order and task's map to the computational resources, additional populations are used to change computational environment to gain more efficient optimization. As a result, proposed scheduling algorithm optimizes both computation tasks to computation environment and computation environment to computation tasks, making final execution process more efficient than traditional approaches can provide.

The generic model of detector used in the framework allows to consider detection of various types of threats, e.g. infections, explosives, drugs, radiation. The underlying agent-based models provide data on social mobility, which is used along with a probability based quality assessment model within the optimization process. The implemented multi-criteria optimization scheme is based on a genetic algorithm.

Also for predicted flood that might happen in the nearest time we execute an ensemble on variable input atmospheric data to estimate uncertainty of prediction models. The second class is connected with assessment of produced plans for sluice gate maneuvering. In this case flood evolvement can be controlled. Technical characteristics of the barrier system, model forecast and procedures of plan elaboration add uncertainty in final proposal for making decision phase.

In this paper we propose and analyze the interactive workflow model as the base for urgent computing (UC) infrastructures. Majority of research works in the area of urgent computing is focused on the deadline-driven scheduling issues for the existing high performance computing. This work tries to look at the problem of building a workflow-driven UC infrastructure from another side and to take into account the interactive nature of decision support. Workflow formalism is taken as the base for investigation. After analyzing the peculiarities of workflow-based UC infrastructure we propose an extended interactive workflow model.

The structure of an interbank network changes in the process of its evolution because of the interbank interactions and the interactions between banks and customers. To simulate a temporal interbank network, it is necessary to set an initial state and an evolution law for the topology and system entities. Because of the complex interplay between the network topology and the bank states, the stability of a temporal interbank network is generally unpredictable, even if all parameters and rules of interactions are known. In this paper, we present a simulation tool for temporal interbank networks aimed at exploring the different drivers contributing to evolutionary dynamics of banking networks. We describe a general-simulation scheme for temporal interbank networks and incorporate the creation and rewiring of edges because of the counter-party choices with the deletion of nodes and edges in case of a bank default. An example of the implementation of the general scheme is also presented and include models of banks and customers, strategies of counter-party choice, and clearing algorithms. To perform a qualitative and quantitative study of the evolutionary process, the proposed simulation tool supports the calculation of different topological and stability metrics and visualization of network evolution. The experimental study demonstrates (i) an illustrative example of the application of the simulation tool for synthetic networks while varying the counter-party choice policies and parameters of nodes and edges, and (ii) an investigation of the computational complexity and scalability of the simulation scheme. © 2017, University of Surrey.

Topology-oriented indicators of tipping points and early-warning signals of criticality in networks do not reflect the gradual movement of a system towards a tipping point. Plenty of networks with SIR-like dynamics have restricted numbers of node states. In the case of banking networks, the range space of node states is continual, which allows an estimation of single bank remoteness from an insolvent state. Remoteness and velocity reflect change in the state per iteration and are considered in order to estimate the influence of node dynamics. Both node dynamics and topology are taken into account. We consider the positive and negative impact of interbank interactions (edge presence). Each edge is considered with weight and length parameters corresponding to the size of interbank lending and the number of iterations remaining before it expires. It was shown that the dropping well below zero of the presented indicator, is referred to as the potential of interactions, is a sign of a forthcoming tipping point.

Dynamical processes in a network affect topological changes at each iteration, so differences in initial topologies may result in different stability dynamics. Taking into account the influence of both nodes’ states dynamics and topology dynamics on the network fragility, the following ways of initial topology impact can be distinguished: (i) states of nodes after initialization (as a state of a node is influenced by its degree); (ii) nodes’ states dynamics; (iii) systemic risk at the fixed iteration. It seems that coevolution of network topology and states of nodes leads to the significant and unpredictable changes of initial conditions. We study the interrelations between initial and resulting system’s states for different types of initial topology. Our results confirm that the dynamics of a borrowing process is significantly influenced by topological features of the underlying interbank network. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","scival":"97.956","badges":["Adaptive network","Banking system","Complex systems","Network topology","Complex networks","Large scale systems","Online systems","Adaptive networks","Banking systems","Network fragilities","Network influences","Network topology","Topological changes","Topological features","Unpredictable changes","Topology"],"publicationTitle":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","journalInfo":["Communications in Computer and Information Science","Volume 674, 2016, Pages 596-599","1st International Conference on Digital Transformation and Global Society, DTGS 2016; St. Petersburg; Russian Federation; 22 June 2016 до 24 June 2016; Код 187159"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Kronverkskii 49, Saint Petersburg, 197101, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56780445600&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85005958962","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192377352&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85005958962","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217679300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85005958962"],"ctime":1581095393,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85005958962&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=9448369b08a73faf7e2c15db46987175&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856780445600%29&relpos=9&citeCnt=2&searchTerm=","taskid":"72694240dd0f4595c628c463b70faf2c"}

One of the prominent ways to achieve it is to use transport vehicles with geolocation equipment on board to probe traffic conditions. The issue is that the distribution of devices among the vehicles operating in the network is at times sparse and uneven. This creates the necessity to reconstruct actual traffic conditions from incomplete data. In this paper, we address the issue with suggesting the methodology capable of reconstructing traffic conditions for the whole road network from GPS tracks generated by public transportation vehicles. The method has been tested for the dataset collected for the road network of Saint Petersburg.

Today these investigations have advanced to the point where scholars are trying to not only observe and analyze crowds, but also simulate those using computational methods. As a result, a distinct area of research emerged that draws expertise from various subject fields – crowd modeling. Though the applicability of crowd modeling is widely acknowledged, the conceptual development of the area received rather scarce attention. It seems that it has so far been developing as an area predominantly driven by the aim of informing the practice of planners and decision makers. In this paper, we examine the current state of affairs in a distinct branch of crowd modeling that focuses on groups of people other than individuals as key actors within the crowd. We argue that crowd modeling can be effectively used to facilitate not only for prediction, but also allows to deepen theoretical understanding of the crowds as collectives of people that are complex, contextually embedded and consist of dynamic entities that impose certain logics of behavior. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","scival":"26.825","badges":["Collective behavior","Computational social science","Crowd modeling","Social groups","Social simulation","Decision making","Collective behavior","Computational social science","Crowd modeling","Social groups","Social simulations","Computation theory"],"publicationTitle":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","journalInfo":["Communications in Computer and Information Science","Volume 674, 2016, Pages 492-497","1st International Conference on Digital Transformation and Global Society, DTGS 2016; St. Petersburg; Russian Federation; 22 June 2016 до 24 June 2016; Код 187159"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation\nGraduate School of Social Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217820300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85005950367","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217903300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85005950367","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57188738538&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85005950367","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56541470400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85005950367"],"ctime":1581095417,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85005950367&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=e5c7ba918832b172dc2742cb3caaed00&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857188738538%29&relpos=3&citeCnt=1&searchTerm=","taskid":"a9a896f60d20364c11f97ccf88c4450d"}

But selection of an optimal route and target hospital for an ambulance within a large city is a complex problem. It requires taking into account the dynamical nature of an urban environment. Such dynamic factors as traffic flow, changing road graph, population mobility, and hospital capabilities are sources of uncertainty in decision making on hospitalization, and eventually they influence the functioning quality of emergency medical services (EMS) in a city. This work is devoted to the analysis of this problem for the city of Saint-Petersburg (Russia) with the use of statistical data, public geographic information services (OpenStreetMap), and real-time data on traffic flow (Yandex.Maps).

Big modern cities offer a multimodal selection of methods to transfer between the parts of the city, including various types of ground transportation and a subway. On the other hand, passengers' model choice depends on the available routes, often historically formed without regard to modern passenger needs and fast-changing of cities life. As a result, for the optimization of public transport systems we should understand how the rules are formed, followed by passengers when choosing a specific route. This paper discusses the evaluation of modal-choice rules through ground transportation modeling using historical data collected from turnstiles in the subway and census data.

For example, you can personalize offers based on forecasting customer needs, by predicting the expected time and category of next purchase taking into account the transaction history of a customer. One of the approach to make a predictive and generative model for this task is temporal point processes, which is widely used to make predictions of random events. The problem that comes with building such models is that while learning on a set of clients the resulting model generalizes the behavior of all sources and makes the averaged predictions such that we lose any individuality of a client that we make a prediction on.

It motivates to seek a solution that can work without such data or require only a small amount of it though having reduced quality.

It allows using of metrics-based methods with reduced search quality or data-driven methods which also needs a great amount of data. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble-based data-driven method that tries to learn a scoring function by combining independent functions from a predefined set.

There are many factors affecting the information spreading. On the one hand, we must take into account the features of post and information sources, on the other hand, it is necessary to understand how users react to posts. Moreover, social networks (as well as some natural and technical systems) allow for collecting the data about the actual state of a dynamical process, thus providing the input data for assimilation within the simulation. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent approach for predicting the dissemination of information taking into account both retrospective data and information about the states of the agents within a social network at the current moment. During simulation process, the model receives network state data in form of batches and can modify internal parameters for more accurate prediction. The parallel realization of this approach allows to perform simulation at a reasonable time. The results show that the accuracy of prediction may be significantly improved using additional information collected from an online social network. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"99.402","badges":["forecasting","information spread","parallel algorithm","social network","Forecasting","Multi agent systems","Parallel algorithms","Data and information","Information sources","information spread","Information spreading","Multi-agent approach","On-line social networks","Parallel realizations","Sources of informations","Social networking (online)"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 228-235","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, 49 Kronverksky pr., St Petersburg, 197101, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57195347448&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190225059&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192819264&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217679300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286"],"ctime":1581095494,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062510286&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=1398bfc47a4fe2d82d3f6605ef243823&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857192819264%29&relpos=3&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"f18881d2bdd75eafd7c418a6ce54a67a"}

For instance, the process of issuing informational messages in such networks unfolds though multiple stages. Since some networks incorporate networking and media features, actors issuing and spreading messages can be represented by individual users and aggregate entities (communities and interest groups).

Restrictions imposed by various OSNs prevents obtaining this data in the required volume and time. Sharing credentials by many users in combination with different user needs and their request types can solve this problem, but in its own turn requires a new approach to organize such sharing efficiently and fairly among users. One of the most critical characteristics is throughput.

Our method allows to predict the sequence of events during the development of type 2 diabetes for each patient. Typical developmental trajectories of the disease were investigated, their clustering was carried out, the trajectory patterns were identified and studied. Based on the constructed directed graph reflecting transitions between different conditions of the patients, the clustering of diabetic statuses was carried out using the Modularity Class method; 8 clusters were selected, each of them was interpreted and studied. The method of the disease developmental trajectories creation by means of machine learning methods was described. Unlike static models of a disease course, this method considers complete past information on the patient and his or her previous events, using each event of the course of disease to predict the next event.","scival":"83.589","badges":["Dynamic model of the type 2 diabetes course","event clustering","machine learning","non-insulin-dependent diabetes","the probability of the disease course complicating","the trajectory of the disease course","chronic disease","cluster analysis","disease exacerbation","female","forecasting","human","male","non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","theoretical model","Chronic Disease","Cluster Analysis","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Disease Progression","Female","Forecasting","Humans","Male","Models, Theoretical"],"publicationTitle":"Studies in health technology and informatics","journalInfo":["Studies in health technology and informatics","Volume 261, 2019, Pages 150-155",""],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57209274711&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192820292&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57200213601&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55382199400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753"],"ctime":1581095515,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067109753&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=a70d616997e6c6c874ac72921348d9e2&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857192820292%29&relpos=1&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"dbb79217e6223a36b20a05f0ad8897ae"}

The approach is described with a conceptual framework and basic methods for combination of different techniques. The implementation of the proposed approach for simulation of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was developed and used in an experimental study. Methods: A combination of data, text, process mining techniques, and machine learning approaches for the analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) with discrete-event simulation (DES) and queueing theory for the simulation of patient flow was proposed. The performed analysis of EHRs for ACS patients enabled identification of several classes of clinical pathways (CPs) which were used to implement a more realistic simulation of the patient flow. The developed solution was implemented using Python libraries (SimPy, SciPy, and others). Results: The proposed approach enables more a realistic and detailed simulation of the patient flow within a group of related departments. An experimental study shows an improved simulation of patient length of stay for ACS patient flow obtained from EHRs in Almazov National Medical Research Centre in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

The key issues which form the research problem include a high diversity of patients' population, simultaneous appearance of multiple chronic diseases, aged patients as a major target group. Also, one of the most important problems being raised in this research is limited observation available for chronic diseases as the long development of chronic disease is usually happening outside the hospital. The approach is based on systematization and collection of data from diverse sources and models describing various aspects of disease progression, life conditions, treatment process within a single comprehensive solution. The goal of such solution is lowering of existing limitation and uncertainty for predictive modeling and simulation of chronic diseases. A target application of the approach considered within the project is decision support systems for both patients and physicians during treatment of chronic disease.

Carefully placed obstacles coupled with existing architectural structures can be used to improve crowd safety at mass gatherings. Although this concept is well understood in the field of crowd dynamics, a systematic approach geared towards understanding how different types and shapes of obstacles affect pedestrian movement remains lacking in literature. In this study, we introduce obstacles that are built from different combinations of columns and barriers and show how they influence pedestrian movement. We compare pedestrian dynamics on four base scenarios of crowd interactions namely: unidirectional, bidirectional, merging, and intersecting, and three shape areas: straight corridor, T-junction and an intersection. In order to make sense of these base cases in the context of real-world spaces, we examine the base cases in the context of the Mahakal Temple, the main venue where a huge number of pilgrims gather annually for the Kumbh Mela Festival in India. We look at how the presence of different obstacles affect pedestrian dynamics. Using the PULSE simulation environment, we show that it is possible to enhance pedestrian flow by using a line of barriers, a column, and sometimes even by narrowing the space of movement in corridors, corners, intersections, and t-junctions, while zigzag obstacles, on the other hand, reduces pedestrian velocity. Therefore, installing obstacles should be done with careful considerations and may only work in specific cases. Our results provide ways to better understand pedestrian dynamics in the presence of obstacles and based on this it may be possible to design better layouts to improve safety and flow at mass gatherings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","scival":"98.774","badges":["Agent-based modeling","Obstacles layout","Pedestrian crowd dynamics","Autonomous agents","Computational methods","Dynamics","Intersections","Agent-based model","Architectural structure","Mass gatherings","Obstacles layout","Pedestrian crowd dynamics","Pedestrian dynamics","Pedestrian movement","Simulation environment","Pedestrian safety"],"publicationTitle":"Journal of Computational Science","journalInfo":["Journal of Computational Science","Volume 36, September 2019, Номер статьи 100893",""],"affiliationlist":"University of Amsterdam, Netherlands\nITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation\nNanyang Technological University, Singapore","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56541470400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85049734809","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57195347448&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85049734809","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57202682826&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85049734809","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217820300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85049734809","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192383632&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85049734809","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57202586742&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85049734809"],"ctime":1581095569,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049734809&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=1a4725a843494f39bdec7c859b66685b&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857195347448%29&relpos=2&citeCnt=1&searchTerm=","taskid":"21e32198af13c70af9d4b695c5d337d8"}

There are many factors affecting the information spreading. On the one hand, we must take into account the features of post and information sources, on the other hand, it is necessary to understand how users react to posts. Moreover, social networks (as well as some natural and technical systems) allow for collecting the data about the actual state of a dynamical process, thus providing the input data for assimilation within the simulation. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent approach for predicting the dissemination of information taking into account both retrospective data and information about the states of the agents within a social network at the current moment. During simulation process, the model receives network state data in form of batches and can modify internal parameters for more accurate prediction. The parallel realization of this approach allows to perform simulation at a reasonable time. The results show that the accuracy of prediction may be significantly improved using additional information collected from an online social network. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"99.402","badges":["forecasting","information spread","parallel algorithm","social network","Forecasting","Multi agent systems","Parallel algorithms","Data and information","Information sources","information spread","Information spreading","Multi-agent approach","On-line social networks","Parallel realizations","Sources of informations","Social networking (online)"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 228-235","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, 49 Kronverksky pr., St Petersburg, 197101, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57195347448&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190225059&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192819264&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56217679300&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062510286"],"ctime":1581095585,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062510286&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=1a4725a843494f39bdec7c859b66685b&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857195347448%29&relpos=6&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"ab1ed947a0017cdf484d76a3638b78a4"}

Most of the existing models (aggregated as SIR-like or network-based as independent cascades) use the assumption of homogeneity of an audience. However, to make a model plausible for a description of real-world processes and to measure the accumulated impact of information on individuals, one needs to personalize the characteristics of users as well as sources of information. In this paper, we propose an approach to data-driven simulation of information spread in social networks which combines a set of different models in a unified framework. It includes a model of a user (including sub-models of reaction and daily activity), a model of message generation by information source and a model of message transfer within a user network. The parameters of models (e.g. for different types of agents) are identified by data from the largest Russian social network vk.com. For this study, we collected the network of users associated with charity community (~33.7 million nodes). To tackle with huge size of networks, we implemented parallel version of modeling framework and tested it on the Lomonosov supercomputer.

For modelling we use clinical data of CHF patients. For each task the groups of static and dynamic features are selected and analyzed. For each task 3 machine learning algorithms were trained: XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest for multi classification and Linear Regression, Decision Tree and XGBoost for the regression task. Different combinations of features were examined from both groups applying forward feature selection algorithm.

The study was based on the case histories of 6864 patients with diabetes mellitus, 90% of whom suffer from type 2 diabetes. Our method allows to predict the sequence of events during the development of type 2 diabetes for each patient. Typical developmental trajectories of the disease were investigated, their clustering was carried out, the trajectory patterns were identified and studied. Based on the constructed directed graph reflecting transitions between different conditions of the patients, the clustering of diabetic statuses was carried out using the Modularity Class method; 8 clusters were selected, each of them was interpreted and studied. The method of the disease developmental trajectories creation by means of machine learning methods was described. Unlike static models of a disease course, this method considers complete past information on the patient and his or her previous events, using each event of the course of disease to predict the next event.","scival":"83.589","badges":["Dynamic model of the type 2 diabetes course","event clustering","machine learning","non-insulin-dependent diabetes","the probability of the disease course complicating","the trajectory of the disease course","chronic disease","cluster analysis","disease exacerbation","female","forecasting","human","male","non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus","theoretical model","Chronic Disease","Cluster Analysis","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Disease Progression","Female","Forecasting","Humans","Male","Models, Theoretical"],"publicationTitle":"Studies in health technology and informatics","journalInfo":["Studies in health technology and informatics","Volume 261, 2019, Pages 150-155",""],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57209274711&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57192820292&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57200213601&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55382199400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85067109753"],"ctime":1581095630,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067109753&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=7a2d3a4dce0be9d838e0aa3d5a62174e&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857200213601%29&relpos=5&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"e5fb21e4c41515b41f8d6f2fc6b0b505"}

This is achieved by using classifications models based on machine learning methods. Early detection of disease risks and \"accurate\" appointment of diagnostic procedures makes a significant contribution to value-based medicine. Moreover, it was also possible to identify the classes and characteristics of patients for whom repeated diagnostic procedures are well founded. Calculation of personal risks from empirical retrospective data helps to detect the disease in early stages.

The approach is described with a conceptual framework and basic methods for combination of different techniques. The implementation of the proposed approach for simulation of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was developed and used in an experimental study. Methods: A combination of data, text, process mining techniques, and machine learning approaches for the analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) with discrete-event simulation (DES) and queueing theory for the simulation of patient flow was proposed. The performed analysis of EHRs for ACS patients enabled identification of several classes of clinical pathways (CPs) which were used to implement a more realistic simulation of the patient flow. The developed solution was implemented using Python libraries (SimPy, SciPy, and others). Results: The proposed approach enables more a realistic and detailed simulation of the patient flow within a group of related departments. An experimental study shows an improved simulation of patient length of stay for ACS patient flow obtained from EHRs in Almazov National Medical Research Centre in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

The classification task is solved by analyzing the dynamics data from electronic health records of the patients with the acute coronary syndrome, infarction, and stable angina. Moreover, the approach for identification of model components and their connection is developed. The model structure identification assimilates the patient condition, treatment phases in treatment dynamic. It provides the prediction of better model structure on following steps and request for necessary data to improve the forecast for more informed decision-making. The dynamic data extracted directly from medical information system were analyzed, that is very close to the real process. Using machine learning methods it is possible to make an early prediction of mortality risks. The prediction of laboratory results allows saving the resources. Jointly, both can be offered to clinicians as support for accurate, reasonable saving clinical decisions with minimization risks for patient's health. The simple lab test results like hemoglobin (HGB), red blood cells (RBC), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), glucose, platelet (PLT), creatinine levels are used as a predictor. Such a simple approach to solving critical tasks can make the method widely used in clinical practice.

In order to risk stratification and reduce the damage of the heart tissue, monitoring Troponin level of ACS patients and detecting subtle and potentially important changes as early as possible is critical during the diagnosis and treatment process. However, since humankind has fairly limited cognitive processing capacity, medical experts have been challenged to manually analyze each patient's data, detect subtle changes and make a decision about next treatment steps as early as possible. For this reason, this paper proposes a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) by developing an automated way of monitoring the health condition of ACS patients using change point analysis. A time series data about Troponin test results of 461 ACS patients were collected from Almazov National Medical Research Centre. CPA was employed as a combination of Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) charts and bootstrapping to detect changes. As a result, single and multiple changes in the level of Troponin of ACS patients were detected with 95% confidence level. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"89.604","badges":["change point analysis","clinical decision support system","computational biomedicine","information overload","Artificial intelligence","Condition monitoring","Damage detection","Data reduction","Decision support systems","Diagnosis","Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)","Acute coronary syndromes","Change-point analysis","Clinical decision support systems","Cognitive processing","computational biomedicine","Cumulative sum charts","Information overloads","Patient treatment"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 408-415","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, 49 Kronverksky pr., St Petersburg, 197101, Russian Federation\nUniversity of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57190224801&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062501388","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57207454636&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062501388","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57200213601&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062501388","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55382199400&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062501388"],"ctime":1581095663,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062501388&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=7a2d3a4dce0be9d838e0aa3d5a62174e&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2857200213601%29&relpos=13&citeCnt=1&searchTerm=","taskid":"4aa8701cced78acff87d7f0ed41238e3"}

However, enhanced modeling and simulation require integration of various data and knowledge sources, models of various kinds (data-driven models, numerical models, simulation models, etc.), and intelligent components in one composite solution. Growing complexity of such composite model leads to the need of specific approaches for management of such model. This need extends where the model itself becomes a complex system. One of the important aspects of complex model management is dealing with the uncertainty of various kinds (context, parametric, structural, and input/output) to control the model. In the situation where a system being modeled, or modeling requirements change over time, specific methods and tools are needed to make modeling and application procedures (metamodeling operations) in an automatic manner.

The key issues which form the research problem include a high diversity of patients' population, simultaneous appearance of multiple chronic diseases, aged patients as a major target group. Also, one of the most important problems being raised in this research is limited observation available for chronic diseases as the long development of chronic disease is usually happening outside the hospital. The approach is based on systematization and collection of data from diverse sources and models describing various aspects of disease progression, life conditions, treatment process within a single comprehensive solution. The goal of such solution is lowering of existing limitation and uncertainty for predictive modeling and simulation of chronic diseases. A target application of the approach considered within the project is decision support systems for both patients and physicians during treatment of chronic disease.

The method is based on the patterns identified in the analysis of medical databases with the physician assistant. EHR is characterized by the gap between common semantic structure and syntactic structure what is important for complex processes modeling. This study aimed at the solution of the problem of knowledge retrieval from EHR by identifying the specifics of their semantic structure and the development of algorithms for interpretation of medical records using the text mining. The medical tests description, surgery protocols, and other medical documents contain many extremely important items for the process analysis. By automating the retrieval of significant data from EHR can be also used for knowledge bases filling. Moreover, the proposed method is developed during the study of actual Russian language medical data of Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients from the current specialized medical center which also valuable.

Advantages of the suggested strategy are based on two main concepts. The first advantage was provided by reducing the overall optimisation time due to the surrogate modelling of fitness function with the iterative gradual refinement of the environmental model fidelity (spatial and temporal resolution) for improving the fitness approximation. For the demonstration of the efficiency of surrogate-assisted multi-fidelity approach, it was compared with the baseline evolutionary calibration approach. The second advantage was assured by additional increasing of optimisation quality in the presence of strict deadline due to the building the strategy of multi-fidelity fitness approximation directly during the evolutionary algorithm execution. In order to prove the efficiency of the proposed dynamic strategy, it was compared with the preliminary meta-optimisation approach. As a case study, the wind wave model SWAN is used.

The possible way to obtain physical interpretation is the data-driven differential equation discovery techniques. The existing methods of PDE (partial derivative equations) discovery are bound with the sparse regression.

Often, during the simulation different types of artifacts can appear due to the inappropriate model tuning or errors in boundary and initial data and, therefore, expert's supervision and validation are required. When the number of images is increasing it becomes difficult or even impossible to check all output images manually. Therefore, it is required to use machine learning algorithms to reduce a time for expert's validation. Thereby, it would be useful to develop a system that allows detecting anomalies in generated data automatically during the experiment. In the paper, we provide a method of anomalies detection for the geospatial data. Data in climatographic archives is available in restricted amount and therefore, full Arctic images are divided into sub-zones, which allows one to increase training set. Moreover, this division can be used to account for the spatial dependency, which is required for ice images. An advantage of the approach is the ability to detect anomalies completely in automatic mode without involving a domain expert and manual labeling. © 2018 The Author(s).","scival":"99.989","badges":["anomalies detection","convolutional neural networks","ice modelling","machine learning","metocean","sea ice","Convolution","Learning algorithms","Learning systems","Machine learning","Neural networks","Sea ice","Automatic mode","Computational power","Convolutional neural network","Domain experts","Geo-spatial data","Manual labeling","Metocean","Spatial dependencies","Anomaly detection"],"publicationTitle":"Procedia Computer Science","journalInfo":["Procedia Computer Science","Volume 136, 2018, Pages 321-330","7th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science, YSC 2018; Heraklion; Greece; 2 July 2018 до 6 July 2018; Код 145382"],"affiliationlist":"ITMO University, 49 Kronverksky pr., St Petersburg, 197101, Russian Federation","authorlistLinks":["https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57207451668&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062534297","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56088330100&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062534297","https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56218089100&amp;eid=2-s2.0-85062534297"],"ctime":1581095727,"curl":"https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062534297&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=eb2d7282e869891ded68c5600a533500&sot=autdocs&sdt=autdocs&sl=18&s=AU-ID%2856088330100%29&relpos=8&citeCnt=0&searchTerm=","taskid":"ddd776cd6cb459003fbcc04534a0c967"}

To solve these problems and to reduce human involvement, we propose semi-supervised sentiment analysis method based on topic modeling with Additive Regularization. To evaluate the efficiency of this method we applied it to several open-source datasets for which sentiment labels are available.

For example, you can personalize offers based on forecasting customer needs, by predicting the expected time and category of next purchase taking into account the transaction history of a customer. One of the approach to make a predictive and generative model for this task is temporal point processes, which is widely used to make predictions of random events. The problem that comes with building such models is that while learning on a set of clients the resulting model generalizes the behavior of all sources and makes the averaged predictions such that we lose any individuality of a client that we make a prediction on. In this study, we propose the models, based on the temporal point processes framework with some ideas to solve the issue described earlier - first is to learn on different activity populations, and the second is based on model individual scaling.

To measure the effectiveness and compare results of different machine learning methods such metrics as Precision and Recall were used. During the experiments three clusters of users with different travel patterns were obtained. We achieved 52% Precision and 68% Recall for the cluster of frequent travelers with chosen decision threshold. Trained classifiers could find possible application in suggesting personalized advertisement campaigns for bank clients with increased probability of travel in the next month. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

{"DOI":null,"name":"Application of automated tools in researching internet discourses: Experience of using the recurrent neural networks for studying discussions on pension reform","authorlist":["Begen, P.","Misnikov, Y.","Filatova, O."],"abstract":"The paper presents the results of an experiment that applied the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to assess how accurately they can determine the attitude of 998 participants towards the pension reform policy in Russia who posted 10,592 comments on 16 online forums in 11 cities. The training set was assembled and coded according to a proposed conceptual model of a moral discourse based on Jurgen Habermas’s discourse ethics theory. The main conclusion of this experiment is that the discourse-based approach — based on the identification of basic validity claims — can be instrumental in building training datasets for deep machine learning on a socially salient topic. The experiment also shows benefits and limitations of using artificial neural networks for a deeper understanding of the results of public discussions in an online environment. The main benefit was that the built neural networks have proven to be sufficiently accurate in predicting positions of discourse participants towards the pension reform policy, with almost 90% in the case of binary classification (two “For” and “Against” positions). However, the accuracy level drops with the inclusion of a third “Neutral” category (to 78%), which was a major limitation of the research; that is, the variation in the prediction accuracy is due to the uneven distribution of data among categories and an increase of new data. Yet this indicator is still acceptable when working with Internet discourse data.

For the demonstration of the efficiency of surrogate-assisted multi-fidelity approach, it was compared with the baseline evolutionary calibration approach. The second advantage was assured by additional increasing of optimisation quality in the presence of strict deadline due to the building the strategy of multi-fidelity fitness approximation directly during the evolutionary algorithm execution. In order to prove the efficiency of the proposed dynamic strategy, it was compared with the preliminary meta-optimisation approach. As a case study, the wind wave model SWAN is used.

People regularly leave enough of their data in social networks services and on various sites, thus forming their unique digital footprint. Based on the obtained digital footprint, it is possible to create a complete digital entity of a person in the hyperspace of social media. However, a person is a complex system; therefore, the model of a digital entity must be multi-scale. In this paper, the relationship of such a weakly formalizable side of the user, such as his psychometric indicators, and his digital footprint in the social network sites have been studied. First, it was conducted a series of experiments on the prediction of psychometric, based on data from social networks (Facebook and Vkontakte), during which two prediction approaches were compared: multi-response forecasting, when all psychometrics are predicted simultaneously, and univariate models for each personality trait. Then, in the course of comparing results from different social networks, an analysis was conducted to determine whether any psychometric could correlate equally well in different media environments. For this purpose, a correlation matrix was constructed between the features and psychometrics. Then, due to the small sample size of one of the datasets, an experiment was conducted showing changes in the quality of predictive models, when the initial sample is expanded by adding data from another dataset that has a similar distribution. That is, the possibility of cross-media learning was investigated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One of the general and effective approaches of inferring missing attributes on graph structures are statistical relational learning. For machine learning tasks, the graph embeddings represent topological properties better, but they are not aimed at the attributes prediction. In this study, we introduce a method combining graph embeddings and the statistical relational learning. We consider different their combinations, as there are possible different hidden connections between social ties and considered attributes. We compare the performance using real data from the social network with different missing attributes and assortative patterns: gender, age, and economic status.

A big number of required characters and high standards of a modern game artificial intelligence makes the problem even more complex. In this paper we propose a utility-based decision-making model which gives the possibility to generate characters with believable behavior. The believability of such characters comes from their decision-making process that takes into account not only assessment of game environment, but also their personal characteristics and social status. Designed model was used to generate AI driven characters for a development of player's opponents with personality traits for a computer card strategy.

We use surveillance cameras, which located in the museum. We offered two methods, the first method for detecting people in a closed space and second method finding density areas which people more spend time to visit. The YOLO model makes predictions with a single network evaluation. Systems like R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, on the other hand, make multiple assessments for a single image, making YOLO extremely fast, running in real-time with a capable GPU. For detect people used YOLOv3 algorithm which is published by [18] and shows that it has high accuracy to identify people, also we compared the proposed method with other detectors, HOG, SSD and YOLO-tiny which shows the proposed algorithm has better performance in this point. And for finding density areas, We utilized a background subtraction with Gaussian Mixture algorithms and heatmap colour technique to analysis each frame and figure out, where are the density areas which shows people like to spend more time to visit. The experimental results have shown that the accuracy and the performance of both algorithms are quite good. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here h(z)=∑m=0hmz, hm≠0, is a fixed (basis) function, analytic at the origin, and the interpolation is carried out by an appropriate choice of amplitudes μk and frequencies λk. The solvability of the 2n-multiple interpolation problem is determined by the solvability of the associated moment problem ∑k=1μkλk=fm/hm,m=0,2n-1-. In a number of cases, when the moment problem is consistent, it can be solved by the classical method due to Prony and Sylvester, moreover, one can easily construct the corresponding interpolating sum too. In the case of inconsistent moment problems, we propose a regularization method, which consists in adding a special binomial c1z+c2z to an amplitude and frequency sum so that the moment problem, associated with the sum obtained, can be already solved by the method of Prony and Sylvester. This approach enables us to obtain interpolation formulas with n nodes λkz, being exact for the polynomials of degree ≤2n-1, whilst traditional formulas with the same number of nodes are usually exact only for the polynomials of degree ≤n-1.

Implementation of a really useful smart assistant for a specific domain requires a knowledge base for this domain, that often exists only in the form of text documentation and manuals. Lacks of properly built datasets and often expensiveness in resources and time to build one from scratch to apply data-driven methods with high quality. It motivates to seek a solution that can work without such data or require only a small amount of it though having reduced quality. The reformulation of the task into an information retrieval problem where the assistant responds with a piece of documentation instead of generated sentences may make the task easier but doesn't solve the whole problem. It allows using of metrics-based methods with reduced search quality or data-driven methods which also needs a great amount of data. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble-based data-driven method that tries to learn a scoring function by combining independent functions from a predefined set.

The Interaction Quality (IQ) metric is one of such approaches. Originally, it was designed for SDSs to estimate an ongoing human-computer spoken interaction (HCSI). Due to a similarity between task-oriented human-human conversation (HHC) and HCSI, this approach was adapted to HHC. As for HCSI, for HHC the IQ model is based on features from three interaction parameter levels: an exchange, a window, and a dialogue level. We determine the significance of different levels for IQ modelling for HHC. Moreover, for the window level we try to find an optimal window size.

This developed surface of the coatings is due to its formation mainly from a liquid phase. The chemical and crystalline composition of the coatings depends on the type of sputtering target used. It was shown that, regardless of the type of sputtering target, the crystalline structure of the ferroelectric polymer material does not change.
